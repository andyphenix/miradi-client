"html|/resources/HowToSave.html|  <HTML><h3><strong>How to Save Files in "
"Miradi</h3>Miradi automatically stores each project on your computer in a "
"named file. Miradi is designed like a database program in which each action "
"is automatically saved to this file as opposed to a word processing or "
"spreadsheet program in which you need to actively save your work. As a "
"result, there is no \"save\" command in Miradi.<p>Key hints to keep in mind "
"include:</p>\t<li><strong>All Actions are Automatically Saved</strong> - Any "
"action (for example, moving or cutting a diagram factor) is automatically "
"saved. If you are entering text into a field, it is also automatically saved "
"once you click on another field or close the dialogue box.</"
"li><li><strong>Use Undo to Recover Changes</strong> - As a result of this "
"automatic saving, if you make a mistake and want to revert to an earlier "
"version of your file, do <u>not</u> close the project. Instead, use the "
"<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Edit/Undo&gt;</code> menu command or <code "
"class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Ctrl-Z&gt;</code> to undo your actions as needed.</"
"li><li><strong>Use \"Save As\" to Branch a File</strong> - If you want to "
"create a new version of your project while also keeping the old one, then "
"use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Save&nbsp;As&gt;</code> menu "
"command to create a copy of your current project. This is particularly "
"useful if you want to attempt a \"risky\" change that you may not want to "
"keep. <i>***Note that starting with Miradi 2.4, this is a true Save As "
"command that leaves you in the new file.***</i></li><li><strong>Use Miradi "
"Zip Files to Store or Share Data</strong> - If you want to store your "
"project or share it with another Miradi user, then use the <code "
"class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export&nbsp;Current&nbsp;Project&nbsp;as.../"
"Miradi&nbsp;Zip&nbsp;(MPZ)&nbsp:File&gt;</code> menu command to create a ."
"mpz file that you can then place on your hard drive or attach to an e-mail.</"
"li><li><strong>Use Your Operating System or the Welcome Page to Manage "
"Files</strong> - Miradi stores active files in a special Miradi folder on "
"your computer.  In different operating systems, these are:<ul><li><b>Windows "
"XP:</b> C:\\Documents and Settings\\<i>Your User Name</i>\\My Documents"
"\\Miradi</li><li><b>Windows Vista:</b> C:\\Users\\<i>Your User Name</i>"
"\\Documents\\Miradi</li><li><b>Mac OSX:</b> /home/<i>Your User Name</i>/"
"Miradi</li><li><b>Linux:</b> /home/<i>Your User Name</i>/Miradi</li></ul>In "
"this folder, you will see one folder for each Miradi project. You can move, "
"copy, delete, or rename these folders. Remember, however, that the folder "
"itself is the Miradi file. You can also manage these files from the Welcome "
"page of the Miradi program.</li><p class='hint'><b>Hint:</b> In some "
"instances, you may need to change the default location for your Miradi "
"files. For example, if your Windows laptop normally stores \"My Documents/"
"Documents\" on a network drive, but you then disconnect your computer from "
"the network, you will need to specify a new default local folder. Click on "
"the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Edit/Prefrences/Data&nbsp;Location&gt;</"

"Reports are only one of many ways to export your information from Miradi to "
"other applications.<br><p>Miradi currently supports two types of reports:"
"<ul><li><b>Standard Reports - </b>These are pre-defined reports that produce "
"documents in accordance with the CMP Open Standards. Use the <code "
"class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Full&nbsp;Project&nbsp;Report&gt;</code> button to "
"create a document showing all of your project info; use the remaining "
"buttons to create a document showing one section of your plan.</"
"li><br><li><b>Custom Reports - </b>These are pre-defined reports that "
"produce documents in accordance with the needs of a specific organization. "
"Use the appropriate button to generate the report that you want. Contact us "
"at <A href=\"mailto:support@miradi.org\">support@miradi.org</A> if you would "
"like to develop your own custom report.</li></ul><p>Once you select one of "
"the reports, Miradi will generate a window with the basic report "
"information. Use the toolbar buttons to jump from page to page and to adjust "
"the view. Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Save&gt;</code> button and "
"then the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Files&nbsp;of&nbsp;Type&gt;</code> "
"drop down list at the bottom of the dialogue box to generate a report in "
"various formats. The two most useful formats are as either a PDF file that "
"can be read by Adobe Acrobat or an ODT file that can be read by the Open "
"Office program (this is an open-source office suite available for free at <a "
"href='http://www.openoffice.org'>www.openoffice.org</a>). Once you have "
"created these files, you can then further edit the report using either "
"Acrobat or the Open Office word processor.</p><p class='hint'><b>Hint:</b> "
"Although the Miradi 2.0 report view also offers the choice of saving a "
"document in a RTF format that can be read by MS Word and other word "
"processors, we do not recommend using this format at this time.  Among other "
"things, it places all table cells in individual text boxes, making it "
"extremely difficult to edit text. A better solution is to export to Open "
"Office and then use Open Office to save a document that can be read by MS "
"Word. We hope to have better direct suppport for the RTF format in future "
"releases of Miradi.</p><p class='hint'><b>Hint:</b> If you make changes in "
"Acrobat or a word processor, they will not be maintained the next time you "
"generate a report. As a result, try to make the changes in the appropriate "
"Miradi fields where possible.</p>"

"Miradi can be a great tool for helping individuals or small project teams to "
"go step-by-step through a complex process like that presented in the <EM>CMP "
"Open Standards.&nbsp;</EM>We have found, however, that software does not "
"work very well if you are working with a group of more than two or three "
"people.&nbsp;Too often, it seems that if you use software with a larger "
"group, even if you are projecting the display in large size, most people in "
"the room become passive observers, watching the person at the keyboard go "
"through the steps.<P>To this end, we strongly recommend that if you are "
"working with more than three people, you should NOT use Miradi as your "
"primary work environment.&nbsp;Instead, you need to use basic workshop tools "
"like flip charts and sticky tarps.&nbsp;You can still use Miradi software, "
"however, as a recording device to capture the work that goes on in the "
"workshop setting.</P><P>To this end, the context sensitive Workshop Hints "

"Project Workshop</STRONG> - Taking a project team that typically consists of "
"3-10 individals through the steps.&nbsp;In these workshops, most work will "
"take place in plenary sessions (everyone meets   together).</LI>  "
"<LI><STRONG>Multi-Project Workshop</STRONG> - Bringing together a number of "
"projects together (typically 2 to 8) so that they can go through the steps "
"together.&nbsp;In these workshops, although instruction may happen in "
"plenary,   most work will take place in breakout groups,&nbsp;punctuated "
"with report-back sessions.&nbsp;This approach has the advantage of creating "
"economies of scale because one or two trainers can reach out to multiple "
"projects. It also   enables the project teams to interact with and learn "
"from one another.</LI>  <LI><STRONG>Large-Project Workshop</STRONG> - Taking "
"a project team that consists of a large number of stakeholders (often 25-50) "
"through the steps.&nbsp;In these workshops, it is often necessary to divide "
"the team into smaller sub-teams that each work on one or more targets and "
"associated chains of factors.</LI></OL><P>In addition to the basic workshops "
"outlined above, there are also several variants:</P><OL>  "
"<LI><STRONG>Training&nbsp;Course </STRONG>- Teaching students and other "

"Viability Analysis</H3>A key step in managing any system is to develop a "
"good understanding of what you are trying to accomplish. In particular, you "
"need to be able to define specific future goals, assess the current status "
"of the system today, and measure your progress as you move towards these "
"goals. For example, medical doctors define healthy individuals as having, "
"among other things, a pulse rate and blood pressure within an appropriate "
"range for their age and condition. If a patient is outside of the normal "
"range, then the doctor can prescribe therapy and then monitor the patient's "
"condition over time as they hopefully move towards a desired goal in the "
"normal range.<br><P>This process of setting measurable goals is particularly "
"challenging for the focal conservation targets used by biodiversity "
"projects. Most focal conservation targets are themselves very complex "
"systems that vary naturally over time. It is thus not easy to define or "
"measure the \"health\" of a bear or migratory fish population, a forest, or "
"a coral reef in a systematic and repeatable fashion. Target Viability "
"Analysis is a flexible and yet powerful methodology that has been developed "
"to help solve this problem, based on sound ecological principles. It "
"provides a consistent framework for defining the current status, and desired "
"future condition of focal conservation targets. </P><P>Viability analysis "
"has primarily been developed by The Nature Conservancy.&nbsp;The Conservancy "
"has published a number of different guides to doing viability analysis. The "
"best basic guide is:</P><BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style=\"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px\">  "

"sometimes seems to be very detailed and technical. Often, project teams get "
"stuck trying to come up with perfect benchmarks of target health, especially "
"when the scientific information needed to establish these benchmarks is "
"often lacking or inadequate. In these cases, project teams should rely on "
"general ecological concepts, comparisons to other similar systems, well-"
"informed expert opinion, or failing that, the team members' best estimate to "
"determine a \"credible first iteration\" of the benchmarks and assessment of "
"the current rating.<br><P>For the initial planning, it is often sufficient "
"to describe the benchmarks for Good and Fair, since this distinction is the "
"most important for determining the need for management actions. As shown in "
"the following example, if you treat this as the first step in an iterative "
"process, you can almost always put some initial thinking down. Identifying "
"gaps and weaknesses in existing knowledge is also crucial to help you spur "
"investigations to improve the state of knowledge about your focal targets.</"
"P><P>For example, suppose a project team is working on a project with a "
"grassland target. They decide that one of the key ecological attributes is "
"fire regime and the indicator of the fire regime is fire frequency. They "
"know that the grassland that they are responsible for managing is full of "
"woody species and the grasses and forbs are not flowering well and they "
"haven't seen some grassland nesting bird species in a few years. As a "
"result, they are pretty certain that the grassland needs to burn, but they "
"don't know how frequently the grassland would burn in a natural state. So in "
"their first pass, the team fills out the viability rating scale as follows:</"
"P><P><IMG src=\"images/TargetViability/viability_example_1.png\"  "
"width='557' height='232'border=0></P><P>This team has defined Fair as being "
"\"fire not frequent enough\" and Good as being \"fire frequent enough.\" "
"This is perfectly acceptable for their first attempt. Later, the team "
"locates a local grassland expert. She tells them that fire should occur "
"every 5-10 years to maintain the structure of this type of grassland. This "
"additional information enables them to fill out the table as:</P><P><IMG src="
"\"images/TargetViability/viability_example_2.png\"  width='555' "
"height='232'border=0></P><P>Reviewing the literature and consulting with "
"experts, the team comes to realize, however, that it is not just the "
"presence of fire anywhere on the site that matters, but that a sufficient "
"portion of the site should burn on a regular interval. To this end, over a "
"few years, the team does some more research about the frequency of fires and "
"they redefine their indicator and ratings as follows:</P><P><IMG src="
"\"images/TargetViability/viability_example_3.png\"  width='557' "
"height='232'border=0></P><P>Any of the above outcomes is acceptable for a "
"first iteration of your viability analysis depending on the level of "
"information available.</P></BODY></HTML>"

"called a <EM>conceptual model) </EM>is a tool for visually depicting the "
"situation at your project site. At it's core, a good diagram "
"graphically&nbsp;depicts a set of causal relationships between factors that "
"are believed to impact one or more biodiversity targets. A good diagram "
"should explicitly link the biodiversity targets to the direct threats "
"impacting them and the contributing factors (indirect threats and "
"opportunities) influencing the direct threats. It should also provide the "
"basis for determining where you can intervene with your strategies and where "
"you need to develop indicators to monitor the effectiveness of these "
"strategies.<br><P>It is important to note that a diagram is not so much a "
"step in the adaptive management process, as a tool that your team can use to "
"go through a number of the steps including in particular:</P><BLOCKQUOTE "

"these steps has the advantage of being visual and, when kept simple,nbsp;"
"providing a simple way to trace cause-and-effect&nbsp;from indirect threats "
"and opportunities to direct threats to biodiversity targets. Because it "
"traces back through the logical flow of influence,&nbsp;a good diagram&nbsp;"
"can also allow your project team,&nbsp;partners, stakeholders, and donors to "
"quickly understand and provide input into your thinking. Diagrams are also "
"powerful tools for workshops with partners and local stakeholders. On the "
"other hand,&nbsp;diagrams have the disadvantage of often becoming too "
"complex and becoming unmanageable (to avoid this, one rule of thumb is to "
"have no more than 25 boxes or so on any one page). Also, while&nbsp;diagrams "
"are readily understood by many people, a small but non-trivial fraction of "
"people in the world have a strong dislike of this visual way of thinking.</"

"plenary session.&nbsp;If you are working with multiple project teams, your "
"will probably want to send each team off into a breakout group to develop "

"the chains of direct threats, contributing factors, and strategies for each "
"target.<br><P>As a general rule, we recommend that you follow the process "

"cards to represent factors and tape or strips of paper to represent links."
"&nbsp;It works best if you can put the cards on a <STRONG>sticky tarp</"

"that you want to be able to readily move cards around and to combine or "

"applying an implicit set of criteria to evaluate threats. The danger with "

"objective. It basically involves determining and defining a set of criteria "

"software such as Miradi can be a great tool for helping individuals or small "
"project teams to go step-by-step through a complex process like that "
"presented in the <EM>CMP Open Standards.&nbsp;</EM>We have found, however, "
"that software does not work very well if you are working with a group of "
"more than two or three people.&nbsp;Too often, it seems that if you use "
"software with a larger group, even if you are projecting the display in "
"large size, most people in the room become passive observers, watching the "
"person at the keyboard go through the steps.<P>To this end, we strongly "
"recommend that if you are working with more than three people, you should "
"NOT use Miradi as your primary work environment.&nbsp;Instead, you need to "
"use basic workshop tools like flip charts and sticky tarps.&nbsp;You can "
"still use Miradi software, however, as a recording device to capture the "
"work that goes on in the workshop setting.</P><P>To this end, the context "
"sensitive Workshop Hints pages will give you advice on how to develop and "
"run a workshop covering each step in the <EM>CMP Open Standards</EM>.</"
"P><br><hr><H3>Types of Workshops</H3><P>There are three main types of "
"workshops that people commonly hold, each with its own set of logistical "
"challenges.&nbsp;All four, however, involve going through the basic step-by-"
"step process outlined in the <EM>CMP Open Standards</EM> and in Miradi.</"
"P><OL>  <LI><STRONG>Basic Project Workshop</STRONG> - Taking a project team "
"that typically consists of 3-10 individals through the steps.&nbsp;In these "
"workshops, most work will take place in plenary sessions (everyone meets   "
"together).</LI>  <LI><STRONG>Multi-Project Workshop</STRONG> - Bringing "
"together a number of projects together (typically 2 to 8) so that they can "
"go through the steps together.&nbsp;In these workshops, although instruction "
"may happen in plenary,   most work will take place in breakout groups,&nbsp;"
"punctuated with report-back sessions.&nbsp;This approach has the advantage "
"of creating economies of scale because one or two trainers can reach out to "
"multiple projects. It also   enables the project teams to interact with and "
"learn from one another.</LI>  <LI><STRONG>Large-Project Workshop</STRONG> - "
"Taking a project team that consists of a large number of stakeholders (often "
"25-50) through the steps.&nbsp;In these workshops, it is often necessary to "
"divide the team into smaller sub-teams that each work on one or more targets "
"and associated chains of factors.</LI></OL><P>In addition to the basic "
"workshops outlined above, there are also several variants:</P><OL>  "
"<LI><STRONG>Training&nbsp;Course </STRONG>- Teaching students and other "
"people interested in learning how to apply the<EM> CMP Open Standards</EM> "
"through a basic training course.&nbsp;In these courses, small groups of "
"students will go through the steps using one or more \"practice\" projects.</"

"students   how to apply the <EM>CMP Open Standards</EM> through a self-"
"directed online   training program.</LI></OL><br><hr><H3>Coming Attractions</"

"to export your information from Miradi to other applications.<h4>A. EXPORT "
"CURRENT PAGE AS...</h4>This command is useful to export a specific image or "
"table for use in a document or presentation. Options include:<h4>Export JPG "
"or PNG Images</h4>Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export&nbsp;"
"Current&nbsp;Page&nbsp;as.../JPEG&nbsp;Image&gt;</code> or <code "
"class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export&nbsp;Current&nbsp;Page&nbsp;as.../"
"PNG&nbsp;Image&gt;</code> menu commands to capture a specific diagram or "
"table on your screen in an image file. This method is particularly useful to:"
"<ul><li>Put a diagram or table in a document or presentation</li><li>Create "
"an image that can be put in a website</li></ul><h4>Export Rich Text Format "
"(RTF) File</h4>Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export&nbsp;"
"Current&nbsp;Page&nbsp;as.../RTF&nbsp;File&gt;</code> menu command to export "
"the currently viewed table to a Rich Text Format (RTF) file. This method is "
"particularly useful to:<ul><li>Export a table or other information in a "
"format that can be edited by a word processor</li><li>Export pieces of a "
"custom report</li></ul><h4>Export Tab-Delimited Data</h4>Use the <code "
"class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export&nbsp;Current&nbsp;Page&nbsp;as.../Tab-"
"Delimited Data&gt;</code> menu command to export the currently viewed table "
"to a tab-delimited file. This method is particularly useful to:"
"<ul><li>Export the current configuration from your planning view to a "
"spreadsheet like Excel</li><li>Export financial information</li></ul><h4>B. "
"EXPORT CURRENT PROJECT AS...</h4>This command is useful to export your "
"entire project file so that it can be shared with other users. Options "
"include:<h4>Export Miradi Zip (MPZ) File </h4>Use the <code "
"class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export Current Project as.../Miradi Project "
"Zip (MPZ) File&gt;</code> menu command to capture your entire project in a "
"small zip file. This method is particularly useful to:<ul><li>Send your "
"project to another Miradi user</li><li>Create a backup copy of your project</"
"li></ul><h4>Export ConPro (CPMZ) File (CP</h4>Use the <code "
"class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export Current Project as.../ConPro (CPMZ) "
"File&gt;</code> menu command to capture your entire project in a zip file "
"that can be imported into The Nature Conservancy's ConPro database. Note "
"that if your organization would like to import Miradi data into your own "
"database, contact <A href=\"mailto:support@miradi.org\">support@miradi.org</"
"A>. This method is particularly useful to:<ul><li>Upload your information to "
"TNC's ConPro database</li><li>Share your project information with other "
"practitioners</li></ul><h4>Export Project XML File</h4>Use the <code "
"class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export Curent Project as.../Project XML "
"File&gt;</code> menu command to create an XML file with all your project "
"data. Although managing the XML file will require technical skills, this "
"method is particularly useful to:<ul><li>Create a file that can be imported "
"by a database</li><li>Export all of your project's information into formats "
"that can be read by other applications</li></ul><h4>C. GENERATE REPORTS</"
"h4>Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Reports&gt;</code> view to create "
"a Rich Text Format (RTF) file that contains various configurations of your "
"project data. This method is particularly useful to:<ul><li>Create a "

"<h3>Welcome to the Reports View</h3>This view enables you to produce various "
"reports about your project. As described in the right hand panel, reports "
"are only one of many ways to export your information from Miradi to other "
"applications.<p>Miradi currently supports two types of reports:"
"<ul><li><b>Standard Reports - </b>This tab allows you to generate pre-"
"defined reports that produce documents in accordance with the CMP Open "
"Standards. Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Full&nbsp;Report&gt;</"
"code> button to create a document showing all of your project info; use the "
"remaining buttons to create a document showing one section of your plan.</"
"li><br><li><b>Custom Reports - </b>This tab allows you to generate your own "
"reports that produce documents in accordance with your specific needs. "
"Miradi 2.2 only supports the ability to include entire sections of your "
"project plan; future versions will allow much more granular control over "
"specific fields for inclusion in a custom report. Contact us at <A href="
"\"mailto:support@miradi.org\">support@miradi.org</A> if you would like to "
"develop your own custom report.</li></ul><p>Once you select one of the "
"reports, Miradi will prompt you to save the report as a Rich Text Format "
"(RTF) file. Once you have created this file, you can then further edit it "
"using a Word Processor program such as MS Word or Open Office. In "
"particular, you can make use of paragraph styles (each item such as "
"Objectives or activities has its own style) as well as table formatting "
"commands (e.g., Distribute Columns Evenly or Auto Row Height) to quickly "
"develop a formatted table.</p><p class='hint'><b>Hint:</b> If you create a "
"RTF file, make sure to save it as Word.doc or other word processor file - if "
"you save it as a RTF file after editing, the file size can get very large."
"<p><p class='hint'><b>Hint:</b> If you edit the report in your word "
"processor, your changes will not be maintained the next time you generate a "
"report. As a result, try to make the edits in the appropriate Miradi fields "
"where possible.<p>"

"<ul><li><strong>Initial Project Team -</strong> The people who conceive of "

"strong> A process facilitator is a person who can help the project team "

"initial and/or the core team. A good facilitator understands the key "
"elements of the process, has good facilitation skills, and can keep your "
"team from getting too bogged down in any one part of the process. This "
"person does not need to be a &quot;professional&quot; facilitator, but "
"should be someone who is intimately familiar with applying the planning "
"process to &quot;real-world&quot; conservation problems.</"
"li><br><li><strong>Primary Contact -</strong> The person(s) that people "
"outside the project team should contact to learn more about the project.</"
"li></ul>These roles can be assigned to one person, or to different people as "
"needed. Two other groups of people to consider are:<ul><li><strong>Project "
"Advisors -</strong> People who are not on the project team, but to whom the "
"team members can turn for honest feedback and counsel and who can champion "
"your cause.</li><br><li><strong>Project Stakeholders -</strong>  "
"Individuals, groups, or institutions who have a vested interest in the "
"natural resources of the project area and/or who potentially will be "
"affected by project activities and have something to gain or lose if "
"conditions change or stay the same. Just because someone is a stakeholder "

"\t\t       Although key ecological attributes are specific descriptions of "

"develop <i>indicators</i> that can be used to assess the attribute over "
"time. An indicator, in simplest terms, is what you measure to keep track of "
"the status of a key ecological attribute.<P>In many cases an indicator can "
"be the same as the attribute itself. For example, if your attribute is "
"population size, the indicator may be the number of individuals in the "
"population if you can count this number directly. If you cannot count this "
"number directly, then your indicator will specify how you will measure this "
"number - for example, for a fish population, as catch per unit effort using "
"a specific technique at a given time of the year.</P><p>In other cases, "
"however, developing a good indicator will require a bit more thinking to "
"find a way of measuring the attribute over time. For example, if your "
"attribute is the water quality of a stream, it is not possible to measure "
"every physical and chemical parameter. Instead, you would select a few "
"representative parameters - for example water temperature and oxygen levels "
"- that you feel can represent the overall water quality. You can also "
"combine several measurable properties into a composite indicator or index.</"
"P><P>Indicators frequently involve some type of quantitative assessment - "
"such as number of acres, recruitment rate, age class sizes, percent of "
"cover, or frequency of fire of a given intensity. Other indicators may "
"involve measurable elements that are not numeric, such as the seasonality of "
"fire or flooding.</P>"

"p>The <i>target</i> refers to the focal conservation target at the scale "
"being assessed - in technical terms, the target occurrence within the "
"defined project area (e.g., small site, landscape, or even global scale). "
"<i>Affected</i> means subject to one or more stresses from the threat. The "
"<i>ten-year</i> time frame can be extended for some longer-term threats like "
"global warming that need to be addressed today. <i>Current circumstances and "
"trends</i> include both existing as well as potential new threats. "
"<i>Occurrence</i> for ecosystems is typically by area. Species includes both "
"single species targets as well as multiple species guilds. If a species is "
"evenly distributed, then the proportion of the target's population is the "
"same as the proportion of the area occupied, but if it is patchily "
"distributed, then it is not. In these cases, it is important to specify the "
"unit of assessment for the target (e.g., breeding pairs vs. nests vs. "
"individuals).<p>For both ecosystems and species, the proportion is estimated "
"as the percentage of the target's occurrence at the scale being assessed (e."
"g. a water pollution threat affecting an aquatic ecosystem target is "
"measured as the percentage of that aquatic ecosystem target affected, not "
"the percentage of the area of the entire site).</p></div>"

"<body>    <div>      <h3>Explanation of How Threat Rating Summaries Are "
"Calculated</h3>      Miradi uses a combination of rules for rolling up "
"ratings across targets and threats, and for the project as a whole.<p>As "
"shown in the grid below, the bottom row contains the overall ratings for "
"each target, and the far right-hand column contains the ratings for each "
"threat. Finally, the cell in the lower right-hand corner contains the "
"overall rating for the project. Normally the overall project rating is based "
"on rolling up the threat ratings in the right-most column, using the 3-5-7 "
"and 2-Prime rules.</p><h4>3-5-7 Rule</h4>Multiple threats to individual "
"targets and multiple target threat scores are first summed together using "
"the 3-5-7 rule:      <ul><li>3 High rated threats are equivalent to 1 Very "
"High-rated threat;</li><li>5 Medium rated threats are equivalent to 1 High-"
"rated threat;</li><li>7 Low rated threats are equivalent to 1 Medium-rated "
"threat</li></ul><p>In the example below, the second row shows the Housing "
"threat. There are 3 High ratings (which equals 1 Very High) and 1 Very High "
"rating, so it is treated as if it had two Very High ratings. In the Ione "
"Chapparal Column, there are 5 Medium ratings (which equals one High), plus "
"one High, for a total equivalent of 2 High ratings.</p> <h4>2-Prime Rule</"
"h4>After the 3-5-7 rule has been applied, the 2-prime rule is used to "
"determine the rolled up rating for a target, a threat, or for the whole "
"project. This rule requires the equivalent of two ratings at a certain level "
"for the end result to be that level. For example, there would have to be the "
"equivalent of at least two Very High ratings to produce a Very High result, "
"or two ratings of Medium or above to produce a Medium result.      <p>In the "
"example below, the Housing threat row has the equivalent of two Very High "
"ratings (due to the 3-5-7 rule), so the result is Very High. The "
"Recreational Vehicles row has one Medium rating and one Low. Since it does "
"not have two or more Mediums, the result is Low.</p><h4>Majority Override</"
"h4>      The Majority Override rule ensures that the overall project rating "
"is not reduced too much by the other rules. Normally, the overall project "
"rating is a rollup of the threat ratings, using the rules above. However, if "
"a majority of the targets have a rating higher than that computed rollup, "
"then that majority rating is used instead.</p><p>For example, if the result "
"of using the 3-5-7 and 2-prime rules gave a project rating of Medium, but 4 "
"out of the 6 targets had at least one rating of at High (or Very High), then "
"the Majority Override rule would take effect and the overall project rating "
"would be High.</p><br>      <img width=\"834\" height=\"350\" src=\"images/"

"hr><P>Conservation projects take place in complex systems influenced by "
"biological, political, social, economic, and cultural factors.&nbsp;Project "
"managers and practitioners operating within these complex systems must make "
"important decisions.&nbsp;Yet they often have limited information and are "
"operating in the face of much uncertainty.&nbsp;Adaptive management provides "
"a method for making more informed decisions about strategies, testing the "
"effectiveness of strategies used, and learning and adapting to improve the "
"strategies.</p><table><tr><td><p>As shown in the diagram to the right, the "
"principles of adaptive management in conservation are derived from similar "
"systems in other disciplines dealing with decision making in complex and "
"uncertain environments&nbsp;such as the scientific method, double-loop "
"learning in social sciences (Argyris and Schon 1978), Six Sigma management "
"and learning organizations in business (TNC ENY&nbsp;2006; Senge 1990), "
"reflective practice (Schon 1983), ecosystem management (Lee 1993), and "
"extreme or agile programming in computer software development (see "
"information on agile programming in this help menu).</P></td><td><IMG "
"height=215 alt=\"\" hspace=20 src=\"images/Umbrella/am_systems.png\" "
"width=420 align=right vspace=10 border=0></td></tr></table><P>Adaptive "
"management is one of those \"buzz words\" that many fail to clearly define. "
"Some believe adaptive management simply involves trying something and if it "
"does not work, using common sense to adapt and try something else. While "
"adaptive management requires common sense, it is not a license to try "
"whatever one wants. </p><p>Instead, adaptive management requires an "
"explicitly experimental – or \"scientific\" – approach to project "
"management. As described by Salafsky et al. (2002), as&nbsp;shown in the "
"diagram below, \"if&nbsp;one were to define a&nbsp;spectrum with pure "
"research at one end and pure practice at the other, then adaptive management "
"would be in the center.Pure researchers seek to understand the world and are "
"successful if knowledge increases, regardless of what happens to the system "
"they are studying.&nbsp;Pure practitioners&nbsp;seek to change the world but "
"do not invest effort in trying to understand the system in which they are "
"working.&nbsp;Adaptive managers attempt to reconcile these viewpoints: they "
"want to change the world and achieve a defined goal, but they are also "
"willing to invest effort in systematically learning about whether their "
"actions work or do not work and why.\"</P><table width='100%'><tr><td "

"td></tr></table><P>Adaptive management&nbsp;can thus be defined as&nbsp;"
"\"the integration of design, management, and monitoring to systematically "
"test assumptions in order to adapt and learn\" (Salafsky, Margoluis, &amp; "
"Redford, 2001).&nbsp;This definition can be expanded by looking at its three "
"components:</P><UL>  <LI><STRONG>Testing</STRONG> <STRONG>assumptions</"
"STRONG> is about   systematically trying different actions to achieve a "
"desired outcome. It is   not, however, a random trial-and-error process. "
"Instead, it involves   strategically choosing actions and explicitly "
"outlining the assumptions about   how those actions will help achieve "
"project goals and objectives. Teams then   monitor the actual results to see "
"how they compare to the ones predicted by   their assumptions. The key is to "
"develop an understanding of not only which   actions work and which do not, "
"but also why.</LI></UL><UL>  <LI><STRONG>Adaptation</STRONG> is about using "
"monitoring results to improve a   project. If project actions did not "
"achieve the expected results, it is   because the project assumptions were "
"wrong, the actions were poorly executed,   the conditions at the project "
"site have changed, the monitoring was faulty –   or some combination of "
"these problems. Adaptation involves changing   assumptions and interventions "
"to respond to the new information obtained   through monitoring efforts.</"
"LI></UL><UL>  <LI><STRONG>Learning</STRONG> is about systematically "
"documenting a project   team's process and results. This documentation will "
"help the team avoid making   similar mistakes in the future. Furthermore, it "
"will enable those in the   broader conservation community to benefit from "
"the team's experiences. </LI></UL><P>To practice adaptive management, a "
"conservation project team has to go through the steps in the project cycle "

"table><HR><P>Biodiversity conservation projects are implemented by hundreds "
"of international, national and local groups that include nonprofit "
"organizations, government entities, for-profit companies, and other actors. "
"The network of funders supporting the work of conservationists is also quite "
"extensive and includes individual donors, private foundations, and "
"organizations such as the U.N., World Bank, bilateral aid organizations, and "
"government bodies at all levels. While biodiversity conservation "
"practitioners have made significant advances in recent years, they face "
"several challenges related to the adaptive management of their projects (see "
"section on adaptive mangement for a definition of this concept):</P><UL>  "
"<LI><STRONG>Designing and Implementing Effective Actions</STRONG> – In the   "
"face of growing threats and limited resources, practitioners need to be "
"able   to understand the context they are working in, select the actions "
"that will   give the highest returns on their investments, and implement "
"these actions in   an effective and efficient fashion.   "
"<LI><STRONG>Measuring and Documenting Impact</STRONG> – In light of the   "
"increased demand for accountability among private donors, governments and "
"the   general public, practitioners need to be able to measure and document "
"the   effectiveness of their actions. This is a particular challenge "
"because   conservation projects operate amid tremendous complexity and over "
"long time   scales. Since most projects have multiple managers and donors "
"that they report   to, each with their own unique reporting format, this "
"reporting process also   consumes valuable project staff time and "
"resources.   <LI><STRONG>Promoting Collaborative Learning</STRONG> – Meeting "
"the previous   two challenges is hampered by the traditional lack of "
"collaboration among the   major practitioners. This absence of cooperation "
"has led to the proliferation   of multiple planning frameworks and "
"conservation terminologies that have made   communication between groups "
"even more difficult. As a result, there is   significant duplication of "
"effort among practitioners and little knowledge   regarding which practices "
"are most effective and which are not. Practitioners   need to be able to "
"learn from their successes and failures and to share what   they have "
"learned with others.</LI></UL><P>Recognizing these problems and their "
"adverse impact on the practice of conservation, a number of leading "
"conservation organizations have come together to form a consortium known as "
"the Conservation Measures Partnership (CMP). To achieve its goal of "
"improving the practice of conservation, the CMP is developing and promoting "
"common standards and tools for planning, implementation and measuring "
"conservation impact. Each organization within CMP has biodiversity "
"conservation as its primary goal, has a focus on field-based conservation "
"actions and is working to develop better approaches to project design, "
"management, and assessment. CMP Core Members include: the African Wildlife "
"Foundation (AWF), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), the Wildlife Conservation "
"Society (WCS) and the Worldwide Fund for Nature/ World Wildlife Fund (WWF). "
"Collaborating Members include: the Cambridge Conservation Forum, "
"Conservation International (CI),&nbsp;Enterprise Works Worldwide, "
"Foundations of Success, IUCN, RARE Center, and the World Commission on "
"Protected Areas. </P><P>The CMP members have come together to work on issues "
"related to project design, impact assessment, and learning because they "
"believe that, collectively, they have a greater chance of making significant "
"progress on designing and implementing effective adaptive management "
"systems. More information about the CMP and its initiatives is available at "

"Perspective</H3><P>When the members of the Conservation Measures Partnership "
"first started discussing this program, not knowing much about software "
"development, we bought a copy of the <i>Dummies Guide to Software Project "
"Management</i>.&nbsp;This guide basically said that we had to work through "
"the following steps:</P><P>1. Gather all requirements<br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;2. "
"Design the entire system<br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Write the code "
"for the application<br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Test and "
"debug the entire&nbsp;application<br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"
"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Deploy the application which will now work<br></br></"
"P><P dir=ltr>Even at the time, this \"waterfall\" method of programming - so "
"named because once you&nbsp;complete one step, there is no going back to it -"
"&nbsp;seemed like a difficult thing to do.&nbsp;We weren't sure exactly what "
"we wanted the program to do, so it seemed hard to design the entire system.</"
"P><table><tr><td><P>When we met with the Benetech team, they told us about a "
"relatively new programming method called <STRONG>Agile Development</STRONG>, "
"typified by a specific process know as <STRONG>Extreme Programming (XP)</"
"STRONG>.<STRONG>&nbsp;</STRONG>As outlined in the following diagram, Agile "
"Development involves going through an iterative process of defining user "
"stories (things that people want the software to do), writing modules of "
"code in weekly iterations, testing these iterations, and then using the "
"results to refine both the code and your list of stories.</P><P>Light bulbs "
"started going off&nbsp;-&nbsp;here in the world of software was&nbsp;the "
"same adaptive management approach that we have been advocating in "
"conservation!!&nbsp;And interestingly, it has evolved for the same reason - "
"a need to make decisions in the face of complexity and uncertainty.&nbsp;"
"There is no way two years ago that we could have predicted that we would "
"need many of the features that are in the current release of the software - "
"we could only arrive at them through a systematic, iterative process.</P></"
"td><td width='410'><img src='images/Umbrella/agileProgrammingCycle.png' "
"width='406' height='307'></img></td></tr></table><P dir=ltr>Just as adaptive "
"management is not a license to do \"whatever you want,\" but instead must "
"carefully state your assumptions and then deliberately&nbsp;test them, so "
"too Agile Programming requires a disciplined approach.&nbsp;We the users can "
"suggest any stories we want.&nbsp;But the engineers will then log them into "
"our tracking system and provide estimates of how much programming time will "
"be required to complete each step.&nbsp;We then meet with the engineers "
"before each weekly iteration to collectively&nbsp;decide what stories we "
"will do that week, trying to get the most \"user value\" for that week's "
"worth of engineering time.&nbsp;We users also then have to make sure that we "
"test and provide feedback on the results of that weeks' iteration.</"
"P><P>We're not sure that this agile process would work with a much larger "
"project requiring dozens of programmers versus the handful that we worked "
"with.&nbsp;And it is obviously clearly dependent on having software "
"engineers who&nbsp;are deeply skilled, enthusiastically willing to keep "
"changing things, able to dive in and rapidly get up to speed on new subject "
"material, ask intelligent questions, be problem solvers, and make "
"substantial contributions to design and function elements that enrich "
"submitted stories as well as produce new stories.&nbsp;But&nbsp;with those "
"caveats, the agile process&nbsp;seems to work really well.&nbsp; </P><P "
"dir=ltr>So why are we providing you with all this navel gazing about our "
"development process?&nbsp;There are two important messages we wish to convey."
"</P><P dir=ltr>1.&nbsp; <STRONG>We&nbsp;Need Your Stories</STRONG>&nbsp;- "
"Because we are using Agile Programming, we collectively have the power to "
"change whatever we want in this software program.&nbsp;If you the user find "
"something minor that bothers you (when you click on a factor, the wrong "
"thing is selected) or have a grand idea of how to improve the software "
"(adding an entire&nbsp;module that does....), you should know that we can "
"make it happen.&nbsp;Drop us a note at <A href=\"mailto:feedback@miradi.org"
"\">feedback@miradi.org</A>.&nbsp;We won't guarantee that we will satisfy all "
"requests.&nbsp;But we will certainly consider it - and at least get back to "
"you to discuss it with you.</P><P dir=ltr><STRONG>2.&nbsp; Agile "
"Programming / Adaptive Management Works</STRONG> - Although we are preaching "
"the gospel of&nbsp;Adaptive Management in conservation, we (as of yet) still "
"only have a limited number of stories showing that this approach adds value."
"&nbsp;Our experiences with Agile Programming have left us convinced that in "
"the face of uncertainty and complexity, a flexible and yet deliberate "
"iterative approach is the only way to go.&nbsp;We can't imagine undertaking "
"another software program any other way - and it give us faith that we are on "
"the right track in conservation too.<BR></P><p></p><HR><H3 dir=ltr>B.&nbsp; "
"The Engineer's Perspective</H3><p>Agile software development has been around "
"for decades, but was only recognized and named a few years ago. In 2001, "
"practitioners of so-called \"lightweight\" methodologies got together and "
"created the <a href='http://www.agilemanifesto.org/'>Agile Manifesto</a>. "
"Since then, Agile development has continued to gain popularity and "
"credibility, especially for projects with fewer than ten developers.</"
"p><p>Shifting to <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Agile_programming'>Agile Programming</a> from a more traditional methodology "
"can be very challenging. Users take on more responsibility for prioritizing, "
"and are expected to remain actively involved throughout the entire "
"development cycle.Programmers have to let go of the idea that everything can "
"be planned up front, and be willing to change direction as required. In "
"order for that to be possible, the source code must always be kept clean and "
"simple, and most agile projects use extensive automated tests to ensure high "
"quality.</p><p>Extreme Programming (XP) is one specific form of Agile "
"development. It is so famous that some people think that all Agile "
"development must be \"extreme\". XP can work well, but it is very difficult "
"to implement successfully, and is not appropriate for all teams or projects."
"For Miradi, we used a subset of XP that is also a variant of the<a "
"href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Clear_%28software_development%"
"29'>Crystal Clear</a> methodology.</p><p>For us, the benefits of Agile "
"Programming include:<ul><li>Early delivery of working software</"
"li><li>Responsiveness to changing requirements</li><li>Low defect counts</"
"li><li>Efficient use of funds</li><li>Avoiding end-of-cycle \"death marches"

"our goals, the conservation community must determine the extent to which our "
"actions are working - and we must be able to diagnose why some actions "
"succeed while others do not. In recent years, there has been great "
"convergence among conservation organizations in thinking about how best to "
"plan, implement, and assess conservation actions in the context of a project "
"cycle.</P><P>Making the most of the extensive, trial-and-error experience "
"gained by conservation organizations while designing, implementing and "
"appraising their conservation projects,&nbsp;the members of the Conservation "
"Measures Partnership (CMP)&nbsp;have developed a set of project cycle or "
"adaptive management open standards that are reflected in the work of all of "
"our organizations and are, we believe, fundamental to effective "
"conservation. These <EM>Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation</EM> "
"are less a recipe that must be followed exactly than a framework and "
"guidance for conservation action.</P><table border='0'><tr><td "
"valign='top'><P><br>Our goal in developing these <EM>Open Standards</EM> is "
"to bring together common concepts, approaches, and terminology in "
"conservation project design, management, and monitoring in order to help "
"practitioners improve the practice of conservation. In particular, these "
"standards are meant to provide the principles, tasks, and guidance necessary "
"for the successful implementation of conservation projects. As members of "
"CMP, we hope that by developing these open standards, our colleagues in our "
"respective organizations - and across the conservation landscape - will have "
"clear guidance on how to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of their "
"projects for maximum conservation gain. In addition, we anticipate that "
"these standards will comprise the foundation of a useful conservation audit "
"process.</p><br><p>We have organized the main ingredients of these open "
"standards - principles, tasks, and guidance - into seven steps that comprise "
"the project management cycle including conceptualization, planning, "
"implementation, analysis, adaptation, communication, and iteration (go to <A "
"href=\"http://www.ConservationMeasures.org\"><U><FONT color=#0000ff>www."
"ConservationMeasures.org</U></FONT></A> to download the full version of the "
"standards). Although we present the standards as a linear series of steps or "
"stages, the entire process is rarely applied in a linear fashion from start "
"to finish - instead it is typically only a rough approximation of the more "
"complex series of back-and-forth movements that a project goes through.</P></"

"the Conservation Measures Partnership (CMP) each have their own "
"organizational version of the CMP <EM>Open Standards.&nbsp;</EM>There is a "
"long and complex history of exchange between these organizational versions "
"and the CMP \"generic\" version of these standards.&nbsp;For example, The "
"Nature Conservancy started with its 5-S process in the 1990s.&nbsp;"
"Similarly, Foundations of Success staff published the <EM>Measures of "
"Success</EM> approach around the same time. WWF and WCS, by contrast, had no "
"one set of standards; instead each office had its own version.</P><P "
"align=left>The CMP <EM>Open Standards </EM>were initially developed by "
"bringing together commonalities across these different versions into Version "
"1.0 of the <EM>Open Standards.</EM>&nbsp; However, at that point, WWF then "
"took this Version 1.0 and refined it to meet their needs, developing the "
"<EM>WWF Project and Programme Standards</EM> shown below.&nbsp;Similarly, "
"TNC took their 5-S process and refined it to&nbsp;fit the <EM>Open "
"Standards</EM>, producing the <EM>TNC Conservation Action Planning (CAP)"
"&nbsp;Approach</EM> shown below. And the WCS Living Landscapes Program "
"developed their own version of the&nbsp;project cycle shown below.&nbsp;The "
"CMP the evaluated the changes made by WWF, TNC, FOS, WCS&nbsp;and others, "
"and used them to produce Version 2.0 of the <EM>Open Standards</EM> that "
"reflect what has been learned from these experiences. As a result, each "
"organization has a version of the standards that meets their specific needs, "
"but at the same time, all can learn from one another.&nbsp; A further "
"benefit is that members of each organization can use Miradi Software in "
"their work with only minimal \"translation\" being needed.</P><P "

"html|/resources/WWFAbout.html|  <h3>About WWF</h3>WWF was formed in 1961. It "
"was the product of a deep concern held by a few eminent gentlemen who were "
"worried by what they saw happening in our world at that time. Since those "
"early days WWF has grown to be one of the largest conservation organizations "
"in the world.  Currently there are more than 2000 WWF conservation projects "
"underway around the world. The vast majority of these focus on local issues. "
"They range from school nature gardens in Zambia, to initiatives that appear "
"on the packaging in your local supermarket; from the restoration of "
"orangutan habitats to the establishment of giant panda reserves. <p>In this "
"new millennium WWF continues to improve its work as it focuses on issues "
"that are relevant to people around the world. Our initiatives aim to "
"conserve some of the most important natural places on Earth. In complement "
"to our placed-based work, WWF also focuses efforts on a set of ecologically, "
"economically and culturally important species. WWF believes that targeting "
"efforts to reduce humanity's footprint on our planet so that there are "
"enough natural resources, space and air for people and other forms of life "
"is also of prime concern. In all of our efforts, we try to understand the "
"drivers of change so that our actions are well planned and executed.</"
"p><p>All of our work involves partnerships of one sort or another. We team "
"up with local non-profit agencies and other global NGOs. We form "
"relationships with village elders, local councils and regional and national "
"government offices. And in this day and age of globalization, critically, we "
"work with businesses who are willing to change themselves and facilitate "
"change in their sector.</p><p><b>WWF's Mission:</b><br>To stop the "
"degradation of the planet's natural environment and to build a future in "
"which humans live in harmony with nature, by:<li>conserving the world's "
"biological diversity</li><li>ensuring that the use of renewable natural "
"resources is sustainable</li><li>promoting the reduction of pollution and "
