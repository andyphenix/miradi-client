"html|/resources/HowToSave.html|  <HTML><h3><strong>How to Save Files in "
"Miradi</h3>Miradi automatically stores each project on your computer in a "
"named file. Miradi is designed like a database program in which each action "
"is automatically saved to this file as opposed to a word processing or "
"spreadsheet program in which you need to actively save your work. As a "
"result, there is no \"save\" command in Miradi. <p>Key points to keep in "
"mind include:</p>\t<li><strong>All Actions are Automatically Saved</strong> "
"- Any action (for example, moving or cutting a diagram factor) is "
"automatically saved. If you are entering text into a field, it is also "
"automatically saved once you click on another field or close the dialogue "
"box.</li><p></p><li><strong>Use Undo to Recover Unwanted Changes</strong> - "
"As a result of this automatic saving, if you make a mistake and want to "
"revert to an earlier version of your file, do <u>not</u> close the project. "
"Instead, use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Edit/Undo&gt;</code> menu "
"command or <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Ctrl-Z&gt;</code> to undo your "
"actions as needed.</li><p></p><li><strong>Use \"Save As\" to Branch a File</"
"strong> - If you want to create a new version of your project while also "
"keeping the old one, then use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/"
"Save&nbsp;As&gt;</code> menu command to create a copy of your current "
"project. This is particularly useful if you want to attempt a \"risky\" "
"change that you may not want to keep, but you must use Save As <b>before</b> "
"you make the changes. If you make the changes and then use Save As, you will "
"end up with 2 copies of the project that both have those changes, and there "
"will be no way to get back to the earlier version.</li><p></"
"p><li><strong>Use Your Operating System or the Inital Welcome (aka No-"
"Project) Page to Manage Files</strong> - Miradi stores active files in a "
"special Miradi folder on your computer.  In different operating systems, "
"these are: <ul><li><b>Windows XP:</b> C:\\Documents and Settings\\<i>Your "
"User Name</i>\\My Documents\\Miradi</li><li><b>Windows Vista:</b> C:\\Users"
"\\<i>Your User Name</i>\\Documents\\Miradi</li><li><b>Mac OSX:</b> /home/"
"<i>Your User Name</i>/Miradi</li><li><b>Linux:</b> /home/<i>Your User Name</"
"i>/Miradi</li></ul>In this folder, you will see one file for each Miradi "
"project (with a .Miradi extension). You can rename, delete, copy, or move "
"these files using your operating system's standard commands. You can also "
"manage these files from the initial Welcome (No-Project) page of the Miradi "
"program.</li><p class='hint'><b>Hint:</b> In some instances, you may need to "
"change the default location for your Miradi files. For example, if your "
"Windows laptop normally stores \"My Documents/Documents\" on a network "
"drive, but you then disconnect your computer from the network, you will need "
"to specify a new default folder on your local hard drive. From the initial "
"Welcome (No-Project) page, click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Edit/"
"Prefrences/Data&nbsp;Location&gt;</code> tab to make this change. Be aware "
"that if you make this change, your Miradi files will not be automatically "
"backed up on the network drive.</p><p></p><li><strong>Use .Miradi Files to "
"Backup or Share Data</strong> - If you want to store your project or share "
"it with another Miradi user, just use the .Miradi file in the Miradi "

"html|/resources/HowToSave.html|  <HTML><h3><strong>How to Save Files in "
"Miradi</h3>Miradi automatically stores each project on your computer in a "
"named file. Miradi is designed like a database program in which each action "
"is automatically saved to this file as opposed to a word processing or "
"spreadsheet program in which you need to actively save your work. As a "
"result, there is no \"save\" command in Miradi. <p>Key points to keep in "
"mind include:</p>\t<li><strong>All Actions are Automatically Saved</strong> "
"- Any action (for example, moving or cutting a diagram factor) is "
"automatically saved. If you are entering text into a field, it is also "
"automatically saved once you click on another field or close the dialogue "
"box.</li><p></p><li><strong>Use Undo to Recover Unwanted Changes</strong> - "
"As a result of this automatic saving, if you make a mistake and want to "
"revert to an earlier version of your file, do <u>not</u> close the project. "
"Instead, use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Edit/Undo&gt;</code> menu "
"command or <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Ctrl-Z&gt;</code> to undo your "
"actions as needed.</li><p></p><li><strong>Use \"Save As\" to Branch a File</"
"strong> - If you want to create a new version of your project while also "
"keeping the old one, then use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/"
"Save&nbsp;As&gt;</code> menu command to create a copy of your current "
"project. This is particularly useful if you want to attempt a \"risky\" "
"change that you may not want to keep, but you must use Save As <b>before</b> "
"you make the changes. If you make the changes and then use Save As, you will "
"end up with 2 copies of the project that both have those changes, and there "
"will be no way to get back to the earlier version.</li><p></"
"p><li><strong>Use Your Operating System or the Inital Welcome (aka No-"
"Project) Page to Manage Files</strong> - Miradi stores active files in a "
"special Miradi folder on your computer.  In different operating systems, "
"these are: <ul><li><b>Windows XP:</b> C:\\Documents and Settings\\<i>Your "
"User Name</i>\\My Documents\\Miradi</li><li><b>Windows Vista:</b> C:\\Users"
"\\<i>Your User Name</i>\\Documents\\Miradi</li><li><b>Mac OSX:</b> /home/"
"<i>Your User Name</i>/Miradi</li><li><b>Linux:</b> /home/<i>Your User Name</"
"i>/Miradi</li></ul>In this folder, you will see one file for each Miradi "
"project (with a .Miradi extension). You can rename, delete, copy, or move "
"these files using your operating system's standard commands. You can also "
"manage these files from the initial Welcome (No-Project) page of the Miradi "
"program.</li><p class='hint'><b>Hint:</b> In some instances, you may need to "
"change the default location for your Miradi files. For example, if your "
"Windows laptop normally stores \"My Documents/Documents\" on a network "
"drive, but you then disconnect your computer from the network, you will need "
"to specify a new default folder on your local hard drive. From the initial "
"Welcome (No-Project) page, click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Edit/"
"Prefrences/Data&nbsp;Location&gt;</code> tab to make this change. Be aware "
"that if you make this change, your Miradi files will not be automatically "
"backed up on the network drive.</p><p></p><li><strong>Use .Miradi Files to "
"Backup or Share Data</strong> - If you want to store your project or share "
"it with another Miradi user, just use the .Miradi file in the Miradi "
"directory as you would with any other computer file (eg .DOC or .PPT).</"
"li><p class='hint'><b>Hint:</b>Earlier versions of Miradi (3.x and before) "
"stored each project's data as its own folder (as opposed to file) in the "

"sometimes seems to be very detailed and technical. Often, project teams get "
"stuck trying to come up with perfect benchmarks of target health, especially "
"when the scientific information needed to establish these benchmarks is "
"often lacking or inadequate. In these cases, project teams should rely on "
"general ecological concepts, comparisons to other similar systems, well-"
"informed expert opinion, or failing that, the team members' best estimate to "
"determine a \"credible first iteration\" of the benchmarks and assessment of "
"the current rating. <br><P>For the initial planning, it is often sufficient "
"to describe the benchmarks for Good and Fair, since this distinction is the "
"most important for determining the need for management actions. As shown in "
"the following example, if you treat this as the first step in an iterative "
"process, you can almost always put some initial thinking down. Identifying "
"gaps and weaknesses in existing knowledge is also crucial to help you spur "
"investigations to improve the state of knowledge about your focal targets.</"
"P><P>For example, suppose a project team is working on a project with a "
"grassland target. They decide that one of the key ecological attributes is "
"fire regime and the indicator of the fire regime is fire frequency. They "
"know that the grassland that they are responsible for managing is full of "
"woody species and the grasses and forbs are not flowering well and they "

"sometimes seems to be very detailed and technical. Often, project teams get "
"stuck trying to come up with perfect benchmarks of component health, "
"especially when the scientific information needed to establish these "
"benchmarks is often lacking or inadequate. In these cases, project teams "
"should rely on general ecological concepts, comparisons to other similar "
"systems, well-informed expert opinion, or failing that, the team members' "
"best estimate to determine a \"credible first iteration\" of the benchmarks "
"and assessment of the current rating. <br><P>For the initial planning, it is "
"often sufficient to describe the benchmarks for Good and Fair, since this "
"distinction is the most important for determining the need for management "
"actions. As shown in the following example, if you treat this as the first "
"step in an iterative process, you can almost always put some initial "
"thinking down. Identifying gaps and weaknesses in existing knowledge is also "
"crucial to help you spur investigations to improve the state of knowledge "
"about your focal components.</P><P>For example, suppose a project team is "
"working on a project with a grassland component. They decide that one of the "
"key ecological attributes is fire regime and the indicator of the fire "
"regime is fire frequency. They know that the grassland that they are "
"responsible for managing is full of woody species and the grasses and forbs "
"are not flowering well and they haven't seen some grassland nesting bird "
"species in a few years. As a result, they are pretty certain that the "
"grassland needs to burn, but they don't know how frequently the grassland "
"would burn in a natural state. So in their first pass, the team fills out "

"H3>Developing a conceptual model or results chain is one of the activities "
"that is best suited for a workshop format.&nbsp;If you are working with a "
"project team with 3-10 people, then you can develop the workshop in a "
"plenary session.&nbsp;If you are working with multiple project teams, your "
"will probably want to send each team off into a breakout group to develop "
"their own model. Finally, if you are working with one large project, then "
"you may identify targets in plenary and then form breakout groups to develop "
"the chains of direct threats, contributing factors, and strategies for each "
"target. <br><P>As a general rule, we recommend that you follow the process "
"outlined in the interview screen, but that you do it using colored note "
"cards to represent factors and tape or strips of paper to represent links."
"&nbsp;It works best if you can put the cards on a <STRONG>sticky tarp</"
"STRONG> (see below), but you can also use a floor or table.&nbsp;The key is "
"that you want to be able to readily move cards around and to combine or "
"split them.&nbsp;You can hen&nbsp;either have one person serve as a recorder "
"to capture the results in Miradi, or you can take a digital picture of the "
"end-result and then transcribe it into Miradi.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P><P><IMG src="

"(sometimes called a sticky board) is simply a large (2x3 meters is a good "
"size) nylon tarp that has been liberally sprayed with a \"retackable\" "
"artists adhesive (e.g., 3M Spray Mount Artist Adhesive #6065  make sure you "
"use the white can!) on one surface and allowed to air-dry. This creates a "
"tacky surface that does not dry out and allows any paper item to stick to it "
"and yet be readily repositioned. Always remember to fold the sticky tarp "
"onto itself (i.e., sticky surface to sticky surface) and to open it "
"carefully not to dislodge the glue from the tarp. Over time you may need to "
"reapply the adhesive to the tarp. </P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <IMG "

"Ratings</H3>Conservation must take place in the face of a wide variety of "
"threats. A common challenge for conservation practitioners is determining "
"which of these threats they will try to address. Often, decisions are made "
"applying an implicit set of criteria to evaluate threats. The danger with "
"this approach is that different people might use different criteria or apply "
"them differently. Moreover, there is a tendency to address threats for which "
"strategies and expertise already exist, rather than addressing those that "
"are posing the greatest threat to the biodiversity at a site.<br><P>Threat "
"ranking is a method for making this implicit step more explicit and more "
"objective. It basically involves determining and defining a set of criteria "
"and then applying those criteria systematically to the direct threats to a "
"project area so that conservation actions can be directed where they are "
"most needed. Different organizations have developed their own variations of "
"this basic threat rating procedures.</P><br><hr><H3>Simple Threat Rating "

"<h3>Exporting Data in Miradi to Other Applications</h3>There are many ways "
"to export your information from Miradi to other applications. <br><h4>A. "
"EXPORT CURRENT PAGE AS...</h4>This command is useful to export a specific "
"image or table for use in a document or presentation. Options include: "
"<h4>Export JPG or PNG Images</h4>Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;"
"File/Export&nbsp;Current&nbsp;Page&nbsp;as.../JPEG&nbsp;Image&gt;</code> or "
"<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export&nbsp;Current&nbsp;Page&nbsp;"
"as.../PNG&nbsp;Image&gt;</code> menu commands to capture a specific diagram "
"or table on your screen in an image file. This method is particularly useful "
"to: <ul><li>Put a diagram or table in a document or presentation</"
"li><li>Create an image that can be put in a website</li></ul><p "
"class='hint'><b>Hint:</b> If you export a diagram, Miradi will size the JPG "
"or PNG to include hidden diagram factors. In combintation with tags, this "
"will enable you to quickly produce animated powerpoint presentations that "
"\"build\" complex diagrams.</p><h4>Export Rich Text Format (RTF) File</"
"h4>Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export&nbsp;Current&nbsp;"
"Page&nbsp;as.../RTF&nbsp;File&gt;</code> menu command to export the "
"currently viewed table to a Rich Text Format (RTF) file. This method is "
"particularly useful to: <ul><li>Export a table or other information in a "
"format that can be edited by a word processor</li><li>Export pieces of a "
"custom report</li></ul><h4>Export Tab-Delimited Table</h4>Use the <code "
"class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export&nbsp;Current&nbsp;Page&nbsp;as.../Tab-"
"Delimited Data&gt;</code> menu command to export the currently viewed table "
"to a tab-delimited file. This method is particularly useful to: "
"<ul><li>Export the current configuration from your planning view to a "
"spreadsheet like Excel</li><li>Export financial information</li></"
"ul><br><h4>B. EXPORT CURRENT PROJECT AS...</h4>This command is useful to "
"export your entire project file so that it can be shared with other users. "
"Options include: <h4>Export Miradi Project (.Miradi) File </h4>Use the <code "
"class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export Current Project as.../Miradi "
"Project&gt;</code> menu command to create a copy of your project with a new "
"name. This method is particularly useful to: <ul><li>Send your project to "
"another Miradi user</li><li>Create a backup copy of your project</li></ul><p "
"class='hint'><b>Hint:</b>Earlier versions of Miradi (3.x and before) stored "
"each project's data as its own folder (as opposed to file) in the Miradi "
"folder. As a result, you had to save a Miradi file in a special .mpz format "
"to send it to another user. This is no longer required, unless you need to "
"send the file to someone not yet using Miradi 4.x. Be aware that some of the "
"newer features supported by Miradi 4.x will not be retained in the MPZ "
"exports.</p><h4>Export XMPZ2 File </h4>Use the <code "
"class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export Current Project as.../XMPZ2&gt;</code> "
"menu command to provide a standard output of all the data in your Miradi "
"file. This method is particularly useful to: <ul><li>Create a file that can "
"be read and imported by a database</li><li>Apply custom XSLT and other "
"report templates outside of Miradi</li><li>Export all of your project's "
"information into formats that can be read by other applications</li></"
"ul><p>In addition to the two standard export formats above, Miradi also "
"supports several legacy export formats:</p><h4>Export ConPro (CPMZ) File </"
"h4>Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export Current Project as.../"
"ConPro (CPMZ) File&gt;</code> menu command to capture your entire project in "
"a zip file that can be imported into The Nature Conservancy's ConPro "
"database. This method is particularly useful to: <ul><li>Upload your "
"information to TNC's ConPro database</li></ul><h4>Miradi 3.3 MPZ Project "
"File </h4>Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export Current "
"Project as.../Miradi 3.3 MPZ Project File&gt;</code> menu command to capture "
"your entire project in a small zip file. This method is particularly useful "
"to: <ul><li>Send your project to another Miradi user who does not have "
"Version 4.x</li></ul><h4>XML/WCS Miradi Project ZIP File</h4>Use these "
"formats to export data to systems that require them. <br><br><h4>C. GENERATE "
"REPORTS</h4>Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Reports&gt;</code> view "
"to create a Rich Text Format (RTF) file that contains various configurations "
"of your project data. This method is particularly useful to: <ul><li>Create "
"a document that can be edited in a Word Processor</li><li>Create a standard "
"report for a donor or other key audience for your project</li></ul>"

"<h3>Exporting Data in Miradi to Other Applications</h3>There are many ways "
"to export your information from Miradi to other applications. <br><h4>A. "
"EXPORT CURRENT PAGE AS...</h4>This command is useful to export a specific "
"image or table for use in a document or presentation. Options include: "
"<h4>Export JPG or PNG Images</h4>Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;"
"File/Export&nbsp;Current&nbsp;Page&nbsp;as.../JPEG&nbsp;Image&gt;</code> or "
"<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export&nbsp;Current&nbsp;Page&nbsp;"
"as.../PNG&nbsp;Image&gt;</code> menu commands to capture a specific diagram "
"or table on your screen in an image file. This method is particularly useful "
"to: <ul><li>Put a diagram or table in a document or presentation</"
"li><li>Create an image that can be put in a website</li></ul><p "
"class='hint'><b>Hint:</b> If you export a diagram, Miradi will size the JPG "
"or PNG to include hidden diagram factors. In combintation with tags, this "
"will enable you to quickly produce animated powerpoint presentations that "
"\"build\" complex diagrams.</p><h4>Export Rich Text Format (RTF) File</"
"h4>Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export&nbsp;Current&nbsp;"
"Page&nbsp;as.../RTF&nbsp;File&gt;</code> menu command to export the "
"currently viewed table to a Rich Text Format (RTF) file. This method is "
"particularly useful to: <ul><li>Export a table or other information in a "
"format that can be edited by a word processor</li><li>Export pieces of a "
"custom report</li></ul><h4>Export Tab-Delimited Table</h4>Use the <code "
"class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export&nbsp;Current&nbsp;Page&nbsp;as.../Tab-"
"Delimited Data&gt;</code> menu command to export the currently viewed table "
"to a tab-delimited file. This method is particularly useful to: "
"<ul><li>Export the current configuration from your planning view to a "
"spreadsheet like Excel</li><li>Export financial information</li></"
"ul><br><h4>B. EXPORT CURRENT PROJECT AS...</h4>This command is useful to "
"export your entire project file so that it can be shared with other users. "
"Options include: <h4>Export Miradi Project (.Miradi) File </h4>Use the <code "
"class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export Current Project as.../Miradi "
"Project&gt;</code> menu command to create a copy of your project with a new "
"name. This method is particularly useful to: <ul><li>Send your project to "
"another Miradi user</li><li>Create a backup copy of your project</li></ul><p "
"class='hint'><b>Hint:</b>Earlier versions of Miradi (3.x and before) stored "
"each project's data as its own folder (as opposed to file) in the Miradi "
"folder. As a result, you had to save a Miradi file in a special .mpz format "
"to send it to another user. This is no longer required, unless you need to "
"send the file to someone not yet using Miradi 4.x. Be aware that some of the "
"newer features supported by Miradi 4.x will not be retained in the MPZ "
"exports.</p><h4>Export XMPZ2 File </h4>Use the <code "
"class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export Current Project as.../XMPZ2&gt;</code> "
"menu command to provide a standard output of all the data in your Miradi "
"file. This method is particularly useful to: <ul><li>Create a file that can "
"be read and imported by a database</li><li>Apply custom XSLT and other "
"report templates outside of Miradi</li><li>Export all of your project's "
"information into formats that can be read by other applications</li></"
"ul><p>In addition to the two standard export formats above, Miradi also "
"supports several legacy export formats:</p><h4>Export ConPro (CPMZ) File </"
"h4>Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export Current Project as.../"
"ConPro (CPMZ) File&gt;</code> menu command to capture your entire project in "
"a zip file that can be imported into The Nature Conservancy's ConPro "
"database. This method is particularly useful to: <ul><li>Upload your "
"information to TNC's ConPro database</li></ul><h4>Miradi 3.3 MPZ Project "
"File </h4>Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export Current "
"Project as.../Miradi 3.3 MPZ Project File&gt;</code> menu command to capture "
"your entire project in a small zip file. This method is particularly useful "
"to: <ul><li>Send your project to another Miradi user who does not have "
"Version 4.x</li></ul><h4>XML/WCS Miradi Project ZIP File</h4>Use these "
"formats to export data to systems that require them. <br><br><h4>C. GENERATE "
"REPORTS</h4>Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Reports&gt;</code> view "
"to create a Rich Text Format (RTF) file that contains various configurations "
"of your project data. This method is particularly useful to: <ul><li>Create "
"a document that can be edited in a Word Processor</li><li>Create a standard "
"report for a donor or other key audience for your project</li></ul>"

"<h3>Welcome to the Reports View</h3>This view enables you to produce various "
"reports about your project. As described in the right hand panel, reports "
"are only one of many ways to export your information from Miradi to other "
"applications. <p>Miradi currently supports three types of reports: "
"<ul><li><b>Standard Reports - </b>This tab allows you to generate pre-"
"defined reports that produce documents in accordance with the CMP Open "
"Standards. Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Full&nbsp;Report&gt;</"
"code> button to create a document showing all of your project info; use the "
"remaining buttons to create a document showing one section of your plan.</"
"li><br><li><b>Report Templates - </b>This tab allows you to generate your "
"own reports that produce documents in accordance with your specific needs. "
"Any Custom Tables that you have created in Planning View will be available "
"for selection in a Custom Report.  Miradi currently only supports the "
"ability to include entire sections of your project plan; future versions "
"will allow much more granular control over specific fields for inclusion in "
"a custom report.</li><br> <li><b>XSL Templates - </b>This tab allows "
"advanced users to create custom reports using external XSLT (Extensible "
"Stylesheet Langauge Transformation) templates following the XMPZ2 schema.</"
"li></ul><p>Once you select one of the non-XSL reports, Miradi will prompt "
"you to save the report as a Rich Text Format (RTF) file. Once you have "
"created this file, you can then further edit it using a Word Processor "
"program such as MS Word or Open Office. In particular, you can make use of "
"paragraph styles (each item such as Objectives or activities has its own "
"style) as well as table formatting commands (e.g., Distribute Columns Evenly "
"or Auto Row Height) to quickly develop a formatted table.</p><p "
"class='hint'><b>Hint:</b> If you create a RTF file, it is best to re-save it "
"as a Word .doc or other native word processor file - if you re-save it as a "
"RTF file after editing, the file size can get very large.</p><p "
"class='hint'><b>Hint:</b> If you edit the report in your word processor, the "
"next time you generate a report, those changes will not be maintained and "
"you will have to edit the output again.</p>"

"\t\t            There are several different ways to approach building a "
"results chain. \t\t\t\t<P>One way is to work from the left to the right, "
"asking what the immediate results of the strategy should be, what "
"intermediate results they will in turn produce, and what additional results "
"are necessary to reduce your pressure.</p><p>Another way is to work from "
"right to left, asking what needs to happen to reduce the pressure, what "
"intermediate results are needed to make that happen, and so on. Yet another "
"way is to brainstorm intermediate results and then organize them along the "
"chain, assuring that there are clear \"if...then\" linkages between each "
"pair of results.</P>\t\t\t\t<P>If you are developing a new strategy for a "
"pressure that you have not addressed in the past, we recommend building the "
"chain from right to left, so that you are clear about what you need to "
"accomplish to minimize the impact of this pressure on your components.</"
"p><p>For example, if you are beginning to address tourism infrastructure "
"development as a pressure to a coastal-marine system, then you'll need to "
"determine if tourism infrastructure is degrading coastal ecosystems because "
"it is not sited in appropriate areas (which could be addressed through "
"better planning) or if the problem is that builders use coral, mangrove and "
"other raw materials extracted from coastal and marine ecosystems to build "
"the hotels (which would require the identification and promotion of "
"alternative building materials). </p>\t\t\t\t<p>If, however, you understand "
"the pressure well and have a few years of experience applying a specific "
"strategy, then it may be easier to build the chain from left to right.</P></"

"h1><h2>Audiences and Information Needs</h2><p>The first part of developing "
"your <strong>Monitoring Plan</strong> involves specifying your audience and "
"their <strong>information needs</strong>. Effective monitoring uses the "
"minimum amount of financial and human resources to provide you with the "
"minimum information needed to determine if your project is on track and what "
"to do if you are not. All too often project teams either collect no "
"information or too much information because they are unsure of what is "
"needed. As a first step, you should be clear about for whom you are doing "
"the monitoring. For example, are you monitoring to satisfy external demands "
"for accountability? While this may be part of the reason behind monitoring, "
"it ideally should not be your only or even your primary reason. In the "
"spirit of adaptive management, you should conduct monitoring to serve the "
"needs of the project and project team, helping the team learn from "
"experience and integrate those lessons into current and future programming. "
"The following table lists some common audiences and their general "
"information needs.</p><h2>Table 1. Common Monitoring Audiences and Their "
"Information Needs</h2><table border=1><td><strong>Audience</strong></"
"td><td><strong>Typical Information Needs/Interests</strong></"

"tr><tr><td>Academics and students</td><td>What is working, what is not, and "
"why</td></tr></table><p>Once you know for whom you are monitoring, you need "
"to then identify what you want to know (your <strong>learning questions</"
"strong>) and what you should monitor. By focusing your monitoring efforts "
"squarely on the core assumptions you have made in your project (illustrated "
"in your results chains that link your goals, objectives, and strategies), "
"you are more likely to collect only the information that will be useful to "
"you and your monitoring audiences as you manage your project.</"
"p><h2>Indicators and Methods</h2><p>Once you have identified your audiences "
"and their information needs, the next step is to develop the specific "
"indicators you will use to collect and analyze the data required to meet "
"your information needs. Good indicators meet the criteria of being "
"<i>measurable, precise, consistent, and sensitive</i>.</p><p>Your results "
"chains, along with their corresponding goals and objectives, provide you "
"with the basis for identifying what you need to measure and what indicators "
"you should use. By developing results chains and setting good goals and "
"objectives, you have narrowed down a nearly infinite set of potential "
"indicators to a very manageable set.  Remember, you should aim to collect "
"the least amount of information to show that your project is making "
"progress. Thus, for the most part, you will want to limit the indicators you "
"monitor to those that correspond to your results chains.</p><p>After "
"developing your indicators, you need to think about how you will measure "

"html|/resources/dashboard/2B.html|<h1>2B. Develop a formal monitoring plan</"
"h1><h2>Audiences and Information Needs</h2><p>The first part of developing "
"your <strong>Monitoring Plan</strong> involves specifying your audience and "
"their <strong>information needs</strong>. Effective monitoring uses the "
"minimum amount of financial and human resources to provide you with the "
"minimum information needed to determine if your project is on track and what "
"to do if you are not. All too often project teams either collect no "
"information or too much information because they are unsure of what is "
"needed. As a first step, you should be clear about for whom you are doing "
"the monitoring. For example, are you monitoring to satisfy external demands "
"for accountability? While this may be part of the reason behind monitoring, "
"it ideally should not be your only or even your primary reason. In the "
"spirit of adaptive management, you should conduct monitoring to serve the "
"needs of the project and project team, helping the team learn from "
"experience and integrate those lessons into current and future programming. "
"The following table lists some common audiences and their general "
"information needs.</p><h2>Table 1. Common Monitoring Audiences and Their "
"Information Needs</h2><table border=1><td><strong>Audience</strong></"
"td><td><strong>Typical Information Needs/Interests</strong></"
"td><tr><td>Project team</td><td>How is the project progressing; What is "
"working and what is not and why; How to improve the project</"
"td><tr><td>Project partners</td> <td>How is the project progressing; What is "
"working and what is not and why; How to improve the project</"
"td><tr><td>Donors</td> <td>How is the project progressing</td></"
"tr><tr><td>Communities or stakeholders affected</td><td>How is the project "
"progressing; How will the project impact them</td></tr><tr><td>Conservation "
"community</td><td>What is working, what is not, and why</td></"
"tr><tr><td>Academics and students</td><td>What is working, what is not, and "
"why</td></tr></table><p>Once you know for whom you are monitoring, you need "
"to then identify what you want to know (your <strong>learning questions</"
"strong>) and what you should monitor. By focusing your monitoring efforts "
"squarely on the core assumptions you have made in your project (illustrated "
"in your results chains that link your goals, objectives, and strategies), "
"you are more likely to collect only the information that will be useful to "
"you and your monitoring audiences as you manage your project.</"
"p><h2>Indicators and Methods</h2><p>Once you have identified your audiences "
"and their information needs, the next step is to develop the specific "
"indicators you will use to collect and analyze the data required to meet "
"your information needs. Good indicators meet the criteria of being "
"<i>measurable, precise, consistent, and sensitive</i>.</p><p>Your results "
"chains, along with their corresponding goals and objectives, provide you "
"with the basis for identifying what you need to measure and what indicators "
"you should use. By developing results chains and setting good goals and "
"objectives, you have narrowed down a nearly infinite set of potential "
"indicators to a very manageable set.  Remember, you should aim to collect "
"the least amount of information to show that your project is making "
"progress. Thus, for the most part, you will want to limit the indicators you "
"monitor to those that correspond to your results chains.</p><p>After "
"developing your indicators, you need to think about how you will measure "
"them -- in other words, what <strong>methods</strong> you will use. Methods "
"vary in their <i>accuracy and reliability, cost-effectiveness, feasibility, "
"and appropriateness</i>. The key is to select the most costeffective method "
"that will give you data that is reliable enough to meet your management "
"needs. For many information needs, you may not have to collect primary data. "

"graphical depiction of these assumptions. You can use your conceptual model "
"as the basis for developing your results chains.</p><p>Results chains are "
"also a very useful tool for setting objectives.  <strong>Objectives</strong> "
"specify the desired changes in specific pressures and opportunities that you "

"that you believe are necessary to attain your goals. A good objective meets "

"results chain.</p><p>The goals and objectives specified in your results "
"chain represent what you need to accomplish and the assumptions you hold "
"about how your strategies will help you reach those accomplishments. As "
"such, these results chain components become the ultimate measure against "
"which you will gauge the progress of your project.</p><p>Together, your "
"goals, objectives, strategies, and assumptions form your Action Plan. You "
"should have some text describing each of these components, but you can use "

"<body>    <div>      <h3>Explanation of How Threat Rating Summaries Are "
"Calculated</h3>      Miradi uses a combination of rules for rolling up "
"ratings across targets and threats, and for the project as a whole. <p>As "
"shown in the grid below, the bottom row contains the overall ratings for "
"each target, and the far right-hand column contains the ratings for each "
"threat. Finally, the cell in the lower right-hand corner contains the "
"overall rating for the project. Normally the overall project rating is based "
"on rolling up the threat ratings in the right-most column, using the 3-5-7 "
"and 2-Prime rules.</p><h4>3-5-7 Rule</h4>Multiple threats to individual "
"targets and multiple target threat scores are first summed together using "
"the 3-5-7 rule:       <ul><li>3 High rated threats are equivalent to 1 Very "
"High-rated threat;</li><li>5 Medium rated threats are equivalent to 1 High-"
"rated threat;</li><li>7 Low rated threats are equivalent to 1 Medium-rated "
"threat</li></ul><p>In the example below, the second row shows the Housing "
"threat. There are 3 High ratings (which equals 1 Very High) and 1 Very High "
"rating, so it is treated as if it had two Very High ratings. In the Ione "
"Chapparal Column, there are 4 Medium ratings (which equals one High), plus "
"one High, for a total equivalent of 2 High ratings.</p> <h4>2-Prime Rule</"

"<body>    <div>      <h3>Explanation of How Pressure Rating Summaries Are "
"Calculated</h3>      Miradi uses a combination of rules for rolling up "
"ratings across components and pressures, and for the project as a whole. "
"<p>As shown in the grid below, the bottom row contains the overall ratings "
"for each component, and the far right-hand column contains the ratings for "
"each pressure. Finally, the cell in the lower right-hand corner contains the "
"overall rating for the project. Normally the overall project rating is based "
"on rolling up the pressure ratings in the right-most column, using the 3-5-7 "
"and 2-Prime rules.</p><h4>3-5-7 Rule</h4>Multiple pressures to individual "
"components and multiple component pressure scores are first summed together "
"using the 3-5-7 rule:       <ul><li>3 High rated pressures are equivalent to "
"1 Very High-rated pressure;</li><li>5 Medium rated pressures are equivalent "
"to 1 High-rated pressure;</li><li>7 Low rated pressures are equivalent to 1 "
"Medium-rated pressure</li></ul><p>In the example below, the second row shows "
"the Housing pressure. There are 3 High ratings (which equals 1 Very High) "
"and 1 Very High rating, so it is treated as if it had two Very High ratings. "
"In the Ione Chapparal Column, there are 4 Medium ratings (which equals one "
"High), plus one High, for a total equivalent of 2 High ratings.</p> <h4>2-"
"Prime Rule</h4>After the 3-5-7 rule has been applied, the 2-prime rule is "
"used to determine the rolled up rating for a component, a pressure, or for "
"the whole project. This rule requires the equivalent of two ratings at a "
"certain level for the end result to be that level. For example, there would "
"have to be the equivalent of at least two Very High ratings to produce a "
"Very High result, or two ratings of Medium or above to produce a Medium "
"result.       <p>In the example below, the Housing pressure row has the "
"equivalent of two Very High ratings (due to the 3-5-7 rule), so the result "
"is Very High. The Recreational Vehicles row has one Medium rating and one "
"Low. Since it does not have two or more Mediums, the result is Low.</"
"p><h4>Majority Override</h4>      The Majority Override rule ensures that "
"the overall project rating is not reduced too much by the other rules. "
"Normally, the overall project rating is a rollup of the pressure ratings, "
"using the rules above. However, if a majority of the components have a "
"rating higher than that computed rollup, then that majority rating is used "
"instead.</p><p>For example, if the result of using the 3-5-7 and 2-prime "
"rules gave a project rating of Medium, but 4 out of the 6 components had at "
"least one rating of at High (or Very High), then the Majority Override rule "
"would take effect and the overall project rating would be High.</p><br>      "

"systems in other disciplines dealing with decision making in complex and "
"uncertain environments&nbsp;such as the scientific method, double-loop "
"learning in social sciences (Argyris and Schon 1978), Six Sigma management "
"and learning organizations in business (TNC ENY&nbsp;2006; Senge 1990), "
"reflective practice (Schon 1983), ecosystem management (Lee 1993), and "

"management is one of those \"buzz words\" that many fail to clearly define. "
"Some believe adaptive management simply involves trying something and if it "
"does not work, using common sense to adapt and try something else. While "
"adaptive management requires common sense, it is not a license to try "
"whatever one wants. </p><p>Instead, adaptive management requires an "
"explicitly experimental  or \"scientific\"  approach to project management. "
"As described by Salafsky et al. (2002), as&nbsp;shown in the diagram below, "
"\"if&nbsp;one were to define a&nbsp;spectrum with pure research at one end "
"and pure practice at the other, then adaptive management would be in the "
"center. Pure researchers seek to understand the world and are successful if "
"knowledge increases, regardless of what happens to the system they are "
"studying.&nbsp;Pure practitioners&nbsp;seek to change the world but do not "
"invest effort in trying to understand the system in which they are working."
"&nbsp;Adaptive managers attempt to reconcile these viewpoints: they want to "
"change the world and achieve a defined goal, but they are also willing to "
"invest effort in systematically learning about whether their actions work or "
"do not work and why.\"</P><table width='100%'><tr><td align='center'><IMG "

"table><P>Adaptive management&nbsp;can thus be defined as&nbsp;\"the "
"integration of design, management, and monitoring to systematically test "
"assumptions in order to adapt and learn\" (Salafsky, Margoluis, &amp; "
"Redford, 2001).&nbsp;This definition can be expanded by looking at its three "
"components:</P><UL>  <LI><STRONG>Testing</STRONG> <STRONG>assumptions</"
"STRONG> is about   systematically trying different actions to achieve a "
"desired outcome. It is   not, however, a random trial-and-error process. "
"Instead, it involves   strategically choosing actions and explicitly "
"outlining the assumptions about   how those actions will help achieve "
"project goals and objectives. Teams then   monitor the actual results to see "
"how they compare to the ones predicted by   their assumptions. The key is to "
"develop an understanding of not only which   actions work and which do not, "
"but also why.</LI></UL><UL>  <LI><STRONG>Adaptation</STRONG> is about using "
"monitoring results to improve a   project. If project actions did not "
"achieve the expected results, it is   because the project assumptions were "
"wrong, the actions were poorly executed,   the conditions at the project "
"site have changed, the monitoring was faulty    or some combination of these "
"problems. Adaptation involves changing   assumptions and interventions to "
"respond to the new information obtained   through monitoring efforts.</LI></"
"UL><UL>  <LI><STRONG>Learning</STRONG> is about systematically documenting a "
"project   team's process and results. This documentation will help the team "
"avoid making   similar mistakes in the future. Furthermore, it will enable "
"those in the   broader conservation community to benefit from the team's "
"experiences. </LI></UL><P>To practice adaptive management, a conservation "
"project team has to go through the steps in the project cycle as outlined in "
"the information about the <i>CMP Open Standards</i>.&nbsp; To learn more "
"about adaptive management, you can consult the sources listed below.</"

"table><HR><P>Biodiversity conservation projects are implemented by hundreds "
"of international, national and local groups that include nonprofit "
"organizations, government entities, for-profit companies, and other actors. "
"The network of funders supporting the work of conservationists is also quite "
"extensive and includes individual donors, private foundations, and "
"organizations such as the U.N., World Bank, bilateral aid organizations, and "
"government bodies at all levels. While biodiversity conservation "
"practitioners have made significant advances in recent years, they face "
"several challenges related to the adaptive management of their projects (see "
"section on adaptive mangement for a definition of this concept):</P><UL>  "
"<LI><STRONG>Designing and Implementing Effective Actions</STRONG>  In the   "
"face of growing threats and limited resources, practitioners need to be "
"able   to understand the context they are working in, select the actions "
"that will   give the highest returns on their investments, and implement "
"these actions in   an effective and efficient fashion.   "
"<LI><STRONG>Measuring and Documenting Impact</STRONG>  In light of the   "
"increased demand for accountability among private donors, governments and "
"the   general public, practitioners need to be able to measure and document "
"the   effectiveness of their actions. This is a particular challenge "
"because   conservation projects operate amid tremendous complexity and over "
"long time   scales. Since most projects have multiple managers and donors "
"that they report   to, each with their own unique reporting format, this "
"reporting process also   consumes valuable project staff time and "
"resources.   <LI><STRONG>Promoting Collaborative Learning</STRONG>  Meeting "
"the previous   two challenges is hampered by the traditional lack of "
"collaboration among the   major practitioners. This absence of cooperation "
"has led to the proliferation   of multiple planning frameworks and "
"conservation terminologies that have made   communication between groups "
"even more difficult. As a result, there is   significant duplication of "
"effort among practitioners and little knowledge   regarding which practices "
"are most effective and which are not. Practitioners   need to be able to "
"learn from their successes and failures and to share what   they have "
"learned with others.</LI></UL><P>Recognizing these problems and their "
"adverse impact on the practice of conservation, a number of leading "
"conservation organizations have come together to form a consortium known as "
"the Conservation Measures Partnership (CMP). To achieve its goal of "
"improving the practice of conservation, the CMP is developing and promoting "
"common standards and tools for planning, implementation and measuring "
"conservation impact. Each organization within CMP has biodiversity "
"conservation as its primary goal, has a focus on field-based conservation "
"actions and is working to develop better approaches to project design, "
"management, and assessment. CMP Core Members include: the African Wildlife "
"Foundation (AWF), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), the Wildlife Conservation "
"Society (WCS) and the Worldwide Fund for Nature/ World Wildlife Fund (WWF). "
"Collaborating Members include: the Cambridge Conservation Forum, "
"Conservation International (CI),&nbsp;Enterprise Works Worldwide, "
"Foundations of Success, IUCN, RARE Center, and the World Commission on "
"Protected Areas. </P><P>The CMP members have come together to work on issues "
"related to project design, impact assessment, and learning because they "
"believe that, collectively, they have a greater chance of making significant "
"progress on designing and implementing effective adaptive management "
"systems. More information about the CMP and its initiatives is available at "

"our goals, the conservation community must determine the extent to which our "
"actions are working - and we must be able to diagnose why some actions "
"succeed while others do not. In recent years, there has been great "
"convergence among conservation organizations in thinking about how best to "
"plan, implement, and assess conservation actions in the context of a project "
"cycle.</P><P>Making the most of the extensive, trial-and-error experience "
"gained by conservation organizations while designing, implementing and "
"appraising their conservation projects,&nbsp;the members of the Conservation "
"Measures Partnership (CMP)&nbsp;have developed a set of project cycle or "
"adaptive management open standards that are reflected in the work of all of "
"our organizations and are, we believe, fundamental to effective "
"conservation. These <EM>Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation</EM> "
"are less a recipe that must be followed exactly than a framework and "
"guidance for conservation action.</P><table border='0'><tr><td "
"valign='top'><P><br>Our goal in developing these <EM>Open Standards</EM> is "
"to bring together common concepts, approaches, and terminology in "
"conservation project design, management, and monitoring in order to help "
"practitioners improve the practice of conservation. In particular, these "
"standards are meant to provide the principles, tasks, and guidance necessary "
"for the successful implementation of conservation projects. As members of "
"CMP, we hope that by developing these open standards, our colleagues in our "
"respective organizations - and across the conservation landscape - will have "
"clear guidance on how to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of their "
"projects for maximum conservation gain. In addition, we anticipate that "
"these standards will comprise the foundation of a useful conservation audit "
"process.</p><br><p>We have organized the main ingredients of these open "
"standards - principles, tasks, and guidance - into seven steps that comprise "
"the project management cycle including conceptualization, planning, "
"implementation, analysis, adaptation, communication, and iteration (go to <A "
"href=\"http://www.ConservationMeasures.org\"><U><FONT color=#0000ff>www."
"ConservationMeasures.org</U></FONT></A> to download the full version of the "

"h2></td></tr></table></H2><HR><H3>Introduction</H3><P>In order to achieve "
"our goals, the conservation community must determine the extent to which our "
"actions are working - and we must be able to diagnose why some actions "
"succeed while others do not. In recent years, there has been great "
"convergence among conservation organizations in thinking about how best to "
"plan, implement, and assess conservation actions in the context of a project "
"cycle.</P><P>Making the most of the extensive, trial-and-error experience "
"gained by conservation organizations while designing, implementing and "
"appraising their conservation projects,&nbsp;the members of the Conservation "
"Measures Partnership (CMP)&nbsp;have developed a set of project cycle or "
"adaptive management open standards that are reflected in the work of all of "
"our organizations and are, we believe, fundamental to effective "
"conservation. These <EM>Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation</EM> "
"are less a recipe that must be followed exactly than a framework and "
"guidance for conservation action.</P><table border='0'><tr><td "
"valign='top'><P><br>Our goal in developing these <EM>Open Standards</EM> is "
"to bring together common concepts, approaches, and terminology in "
"conservation project design, management, and monitoring in order to help "
"practitioners improve the practice of conservation. In particular, these "
"standards are meant to provide the principles, tasks, and guidance necessary "
"for the successful implementation of conservation projects. As members of "
"CMP, we hope that by developing these open standards, our colleagues in our "
"respective organizations - and across the conservation landscape - will have "
"clear guidance on how to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of their "
"projects for maximum conservation gain. In addition, we anticipate that "
"these standards will comprise the foundation of a useful conservation audit "
"process.</p><br><p>We have organized the main ingredients of these open "
"standards - principles, tasks, and guidance - into seven steps that comprise "
"the project management cycle including conceptualization, planning, "
"implementation, analysis, adaptation, communication, and iteration (go to <A "

#~ "<LI><STRONG>Adaptation</STRONG> is about using monitoring results to "
#~ "improve a   project. If project actions did not achieve the expected "
#~ "results, it is   because the project assumptions were wrong, the actions "
#~ "were poorly executed,   the conditions at the project site have changed, "
#~ "the monitoring was faulty    or some combination of these problems. "
#~ "Adaptation involves changing   assumptions and interventions to respond "

#~ "table><P>Adaptive management&nbsp;can thus be defined as&nbsp;\"the "
#~ "integration of design, management, and monitoring to systematically test "
#~ "assumptions in order to adapt and learn\" (Salafsky, Margoluis, &amp; "
#~ "Redford, 2001).&nbsp;This definition can be expanded by looking at its "
#~ "three components:</P><UL>  <LI><STRONG>Testing</STRONG> "
#~ "<STRONG>assumptions</STRONG> is about   systematically trying different "
#~ "actions to achieve a desired outcome. It is   not, however, a random "
#~ "trial-and-error process. Instead, it involves   strategically choosing "
#~ "actions and explicitly outlining the assumptions about   how those "
#~ "actions will help achieve project goals and objectives. Teams then   "
#~ "monitor the actual results to see how they compare to the ones predicted "
#~ "by   their assumptions. The key is to develop an understanding of not "
#~ "only which   actions work and which do not, but also why.</LI></UL><UL>  "
#~ "<LI><STRONG>Adaptation</STRONG> is about using monitoring results to "
#~ "improve a   project. If project actions did not achieve the expected "
#~ "results, it is   because the project assumptions were wrong, the actions "
#~ "were poorly executed,   the conditions at the project site have changed, "
#~ "the monitoring was faulty    or some combination of these problems. "
#~ "Adaptation involves changing   assumptions and interventions to respond "
#~ "to the new information obtained   through monitoring efforts.</LI></"
#~ "UL><UL>  <LI><STRONG>Learning</STRONG> is about systematically "
#~ "documenting a project   team's process and results. This documentation "
#~ "will help the team avoid making   similar mistakes in the future. "
#~ "Furthermore, it will enable those in the   broader conservation community "
#~ "to benefit from the team's experiences. </LI></UL><P>To practice adaptive "
