We have found three potential candidates for a built-in GIS mapping component:

jhlabs.com
  A lightweight Java map viewer/editor. Viewer is available under Apache license,
  but editor is currently proprietary
  
openmap.org
  Probably the most mature, but has not released any new versions for a year or two. 
  Available under a non-standard license which probably isn't GPL-compatible. 
  We might be able to negotiate something with them.
  
openjump.org
  New kid on the block, and seems to be actively developed. GPL license.
  

Here is some sample but non-working code that tries to use openjump:

		LayerManager manager = new LayerManager();
		LayerViewPanelContext context = this;
		LayerViewPanel lvp = new LayerViewPanel(manager, context);
		manager.setCoordinateSystem(new CoordinateSystem("Projection", 0, new LatLong()));
		
		
		FeatureSchema schema = new FeatureSchema();
		FeatureCollection features = new FeatureDataset(schema);
		Feature circleFeature = new BasicFeature(schema);
		PrecisionModel precisionModel = new PrecisionModel(PrecisionModel.FLOATING);
		GeometryFactory factory = new GeometryFactory(precisionModel);
		Coordinate[] coordinates = new Coordinate[] {
			new Coordinate(0, 0),
			new Coordinate(1, 0),
			new Coordinate(1, 1),
			new Coordinate(0, 0),
		};
		CoordinateSequence sequence = new CoordinateArraySequence(coordinates);
		LineString[] lines = new LineString[] {
			new LineString(sequence, factory),
		};
		Geometry geometry = new MultiLineString(lines, factory);
		circleFeature.setGeometry(geometry);
		Layer circle = new Layer("circle", Color.RED, features, manager);
		circle.setVisible(true);
		manager.addLayer("Circle", circle);
		add(lvp, BorderLayout.CENTER);
