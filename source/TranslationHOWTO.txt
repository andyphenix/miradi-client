Once-per-language command to create an initial .po file from the .pot template:
  cd translations
  msginit --input=miradi.pot --output-file=<binaries>/dist/miradi_xx.po --locale=xx
  
(where xx is the language such as 'fr' or 'es', possibly followed by an 
underline, then a locale country/region code such as US or CA.)
Then, update the header comments at the top of the generated .po file as appropriate.


The Miradi build script automatically re-creates the .pot file, and 
then updates the English and Spanish .po files and MiradiContent zip files.



  
IMPORTANT NOTES:

1. Never edit the .pot file, because your changes will be erased next time
xgettext is run.

2. Use \n to insert hard newlines.

3. "Obsolete" entries appear at the bottom of a .po file, commented-out.

4. .pot and .po files are assumed to be in UTF-8
