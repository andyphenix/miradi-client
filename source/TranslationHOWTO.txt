Once-per-language command to create an initial .po file from the .pot template:
  cd binaries-miradi/dist
  msginit --input=miradi.pot --output-file=miradi_xx.po --locale=xx
  
(where xx is the language such as 'fr' or 'es', possibly followed by an 
underline, then a locale country/region code such as US or CA.)
When prompted for the email address, enter: info@miradi.org
There will be multibyte errors. Edit the file and update the header comments 
at the top of the generated .po file to change the file to UTF-8:
   charset=UTF-8



The Miradi build script automatically re-creates the .pot file, and 
then updates the English and Spanish .po files and MiradiContent zip files.



  
IMPORTANT NOTES:

1. Never edit the .pot file, because your changes will be erased next time
xgettext is run.

2. Use \n to insert hard newlines.

3. "Obsolete" entries appear at the bottom of a .po file, commented-out.

4. .pot and .po files are assumed to be in UTF-8
