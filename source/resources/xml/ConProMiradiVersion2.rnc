# Datatyping reference
# xsd:boolean -  Its value space is true and false. Its lexical space accepts true, false, 1 and 0
# vocabulary_date -     
#                Its lexical space is the ISO 8601 extended format [-]CCYY-MM-DD[Z|(+|-)hh:mm] with 
#                an optional time zone. 
# xsd:decimal -  The set of all decimal numbers with arbitrary lengths. Its lexical space allows any
#                number of insignificant leading and, after the decimal point, trailing zeros. A period
#                is the only acceptable decimal seperator. No thousands seperators allowed.
# xsd:integer -  Integer is derived from decimal by fixing the value of fractionDigits to be 0 and disallowing 
#                the trailing decimal point. This results in the standard mathematical concept of the integer 
#                numbers. The value space of integer is the infinite set {...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...}. 
# xsd:nonNegativeInteger - 
#                nonNegativeInteger is derived from integer by setting the value of
#                minInclusive to be 0. This results in the standard mathematical concept of the 
#                non-negative integers. The value space of nonNegativeInteger is the infinite 
#                set {0,1,2,...}.
# xsd:positiveInteger - 
#                positiveInteger is derived from nonNegativeInteger by setting the value of
#                minInclusive to be 1. This results in the standard mathematical concept of the 
#                positive integer numbers. The value space of positiveInteger is the infinite 
#                set {1,2,...}. 
# xsd:string -   The lexical and value spaces are teh set of all possible strings composed of any charachter 
#                allowed in a XML 1.0 document without any treatment done on whitespace. That is the only 
#                datatype that leaves all the whitespace. When whitespace isn't significant, xsd:token is
#                preferred.
# xsd:token -    The value space of token is the set of strings that do not contain the carriage return (#xD), 
#                line feed (#xA) nor tab (#x9) characters, that have no leading or trailing spaces (#x20) and 
#                that have no internal sequences of two or more spaces. The lexical space of token is the set 
#                of strings that do not contain the carriage return (#xD), line feed (#xA) nor tab (#x9) 
#                characters, that have no leading or trailing spaces (#x20) and that have no internal sequences 
#                of two or more spaces.
# xsd:NMTOKEN -  The lexical and value spaces are the set of XML 1.0 name tokens, tokens composed of characters
#                digits, period, colons, hyphens and the characters defined by Unicode, such as "combining"
#                or "extender." Invalid values include 'brought classical music' (spaces are forbidden) and
#                'bold,brash' (commas are forbidden).
