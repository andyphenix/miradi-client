Warning: The MPZ file format should only be used to share Miradi projects with users 
who have not upgraded to the latest version of Miradi, and are still running 
Miradi 3.3. Exporting to the MPZ format will lose all the text formatting, along with 
data in fields that have been added to Miradi 4.0 or later.

The preferred way to backup or share your projects now is to export .Miradi files, 
instead of MPZ files.

Do you wish to export this project as an MPZ file anyway?
