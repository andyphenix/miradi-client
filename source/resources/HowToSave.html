<h3><strong>How to Save Files in Miradi</h3>

Miradi automatically stores each project on your computer in a named file. Miradi is designed like a database 	program in which each action is automatically saved to this file as opposed to a word processing or spreadsheet program in which you need to actively save your work. As a result, there is no "save" command in Miradi.

<p>Key hints to keep in mind include:</p>
	
<li><strong>All Actions are Automatically Saved</strong> - 
	Any action (for example, moving or cutting a diagram factor) is automatically saved. If you are entering text into a field, it is also automatically saved once you click on another field or close the dialogue box.</li>
<li><strong>Use Undo to Recover Changes</strong> - As a result of this automatic saving, 
	if you make a mistake and want to revert to an earlier version of your file, do <u>not</u> 
	close the project. Instead, use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Edit/Undo&gt;</code> menu command or <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Ctrl-Z&gt;</code> to undo your actions as needed.</li>
<li><strong>Use "Save Copy As" to Branch a File</strong> - If you want to create a new 
	version of your project while also keeping the old one, then use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Save&nbsp;Copy&nbsp;As&gt;</code> menu command to create a copy of your current project. This is particularly useful if you want to attempt a "risky" change that you may not want to keep.</li>
<li><strong>Use Miradi Zip Files to Store or Share Data</strong> - If you want to store your 
	project or share it with another Miradi user, then use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export/Miradi&nbsp;Zip&nbsp;File&gt;</code> menu command to create a .mpz file that you can then place on your hard drive or attach to an e-mail.</i>
<li><strong>Use Your Operating System or the Welcome Page to Manage Files</strong> - Miradi stores active files on a special Miradi directory on your computer.  In different operating systems, these are:

<ul>
<li><b>Windows XP:</b> C:\Documents and Settings\<i>Your User Name</i>\My Documents\Miradi</li>
<li><b>Windows Vista:</b> C:\Users\<i>Your User Name</i>\Documents\Miradi</li>
<li><b>Mac OSX:</b> /home/<i>Your User Name</i>/Miradi</li>
<li><b>Linux:</b> /home/<i>Your User Name</i>/Miradi</li>
</ul>

In this directory, you will see one folder for each Miradi project. You can move, copy, delete, or rename these folders. Remember, however, that the folder itself is the Miradi file. You can also manage these files from the Welcome page of the Miradi program.</li>

<p class='hint'><b>Hint:</b> In some instances, you may need to change the default location for your Miradi files. For example, if your Windows laptop normally stores "My Documents/Documents" on a network drive, but you then disconnect your computer from the network, you will need to specify a new default local directory. Click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Edit/Prefrences/Data&nbsp;Location&gt;</code> tab to make this change.</p>
