<p>Miradi stores active files on a special Miradi directory on your computer. In different operating systems, these are:

<ul>
<li><b>Windows XP:</b> C:\Documents and Settings\<i>Your User Name</i>\My Documents\Miradi</li>
<li><b>Windows Vista:</b> C:\Users\<i>Your User Name</i>\Documents\Miradi</li>
<li><b>Mac OSX:</b> /Users/<i>yourname</i>/Miradi</li>
<li><b>Linux:</b> /home/<i>Your User Name</i>/Miradi</li>
</ul>

<p>In this directory, you will see one folder for each Miradi project. You can move, copy, delete, 
or rename these folders. Remember, however, that the folder itself is the Miradi "file" - in other words, 
the name of the folder is the name of the file in Miradi. You can also manage these files from the Welcome page of the Miradi program.</p>

<p>In some instances, you may need to change the default location for your Miradi files. For example, 
if your laptop normally stores "My Documents" on a network drive, but you then disconnect your computer 
from the network, you will need to specify a new default local directory. Click on the button below to make this change.</p>

<p class='hint'><b>Hint:</b> Make sure that the directory that you specify is included in the backup routine for 
your computer to ensure that you do not lose all your Miradi work in the event of a system failure.</p>
