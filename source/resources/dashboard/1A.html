<h1>1A. Define initial project team</h1>
<p>A project is ultimately designed and implemented by a specific group of individuals 
who comprise your <strong>project team</strong>. Team members typically include your 
organization&apos;s staff as well as other key internal and external partners. 
One of the team members is typically designated as the project leader. 
This leader should be responsible for the overall coordination of the project 
and moving the team forward. You should be clear about who is on your team and 
what the roles and responsibilities of each member are. The team composition may change 
as you move through the management cycle. The key, however, is to recognize and make 
use of existing skills and experience to ensure that the project moves forward with 
the best available knowledge. In addition to the project team, you may also need 
to identify one or more advisors to whom the core team can turn for honest feedback
and counsel and who can champion your cause.</p>
Outputs for this step include:
<ul><li>Selection of initial project team, including project leader, core members, and advisory members.</li>
<li>Identification of key skills each team member brings.</li>
<li>Designation of roles and responsibilities.</li></ul>
