<p>This first step involves specifying the basic parameters for your project in preparation for the design work that will come in the next step. Specifically, it involves identifying who will initially be involved on the <strong>project team</strong>, articulating your project’s geographic and/or thematic <strong>scope</strong>, your <strong>vision</strong> of what you hope to achieve, and the <strong>conservation targets</strong> which will be the focus of your work. It also includes making sense of the context in which your project is intending to work, including <strong>threats</strong> and <strong>opportunities</strong>, and key <strong>stakeholders</strong>.</p>
