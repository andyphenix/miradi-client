<h1>1D. Complete situation analysis</h1>
<p>This standard asks you to complete the description of the context within which your project
takes place. A situation analysis is a process that will help you and your project team create
together a common understanding of your project’s context – including the biological
environment and the social, economic, political, and institutional systems that affect the
conservation targets you want to conserve. Depending upon the scale of the project and the
resources available to it, a situation analysis can be an in-depth formal study of the area or a
less formal description based on input of those familiar with the area. Often referred to a
<i>needs assessment</i> in other fields, this step is one that is sometimes overlooked – at least
explicitly – in conservation projects, yet it is one of the most important. By understanding
the biological and social context, you will have a better chance of designing activities that
will achieve your conservation goals and objectives.</p>
<p>This standard builds off of work you have already done related to your project context (scope,
conservation targets, and direct threats). It involves completing a situation analysis by
identifying the key <strong>factors</strong> that drive the direct threats and ultimately influence your targets.
These include <strong>indirect threats</strong> (also known as root causes and drivers) and opportunities and
enabling conditions. These factors can range in scale from local to global.</p>
<p>Each factor can typically be linked to one or more <strong>stakeholders</strong> – those individuals, groups,
or institutions that have an interest in or will be affected by your project’s activities. As part
of your situation analysis, you should conduct a stakeholder analysis. You need to consider
both powerful and influential stakeholders, as well as those that might be disadvantaged or
marginalized. As you review stakeholders, also keep in mind which stakeholders could
become important strategic partners that you could involve in action planning.</p>
<p>As part of your analysis of the situation, you should also describe the relationships among
targets, direct threats, opportunities, and stakeholders. To do this, you should use a
<strong>conceptual model</strong>. A conceptual model is a tool that visually portrays the relationships
among the different factors in your situation analysis. A good model illustrates the cause-and
effect relationships that you and your team assume exist within the project area. It should be
as simple as possible while still including the most important details. To make sure your
conceptual model generally represents what is happening at your site and that all team
members are in agreement, you should build it as a team. Likewise, it is ideal to ground-truth
(or field test) the model with key stakeholders and partners both inside and outside the project
team to make sure that the model reflects their understanding of the situation.</p>
