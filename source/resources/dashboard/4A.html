<h1>4A. Prepare your data for analysis</h1>
<p>Analysis is a process of transforming raw data into useful information. Analysis should not
happen at only one point in time during the life of the project. To continuously understand
what is going on in your project – and to be able to change things in a timely fashion – it is
essential to capture and analyze your monitoring data as part of routine project work.</p>
<p>To do this, you need to have sound data management systems in place. You need to have
methods and systems established for recording, storing, and processing data. This includes
processes for systematically checking, cleaning, and coding raw data as soon as you get them
and for storing and backing-up your data. This work should be done for both programmatic
data as well as operational and financial data.</p>
Output for this standard practice includes:

backing up project data.</li></ul>
