<h1>4. Analyze, use, adapt</h1>
<p>This step involves managing your data as it comes in and regularly analyzing it to convert it
into useful information. In particular, you need to analyze your project’s results and core
assumptions as well as operational and financial data and then adapt your work plans as
necessary. The amount of time needed to complete this step is often underestimated by
project managers, leaving them with lots of data that they have collected but have not
analyzed or used. By making this a deliberate step, you should find it easier to observe and
understand changes, solve problems, and make improvements to your project.</p>
