<h1>5A. Document what you learn</h1>
<p>As you go through the process described in these standards, you should make sure you
harvest and document the lessons that your project team is learning on a regular basis.
Lessons can take the form of formal statistical results or anecdotal stories and can focus on
something as large as your core project assumptions or something as specific as a new and
improved way of tracking project expenses. One of the keys to harvesting lessons is to keep
track of learning questions that emerge as you go through the project management process
and then try to answer these questions when data become available to do so. Another key is
to provide time and incentives to do this work. Harvesting lessons requires a balance
between art and science – and will require patience and making time in any work plan for
these tasks.</p>
<p>To a large degree, however, you will have already harvested those lessons in Step 4 based on
the learning questions you have defined. Here, you should make sure that you document or
record those lessons so that they are available in the future to your team and your
organization.</p>
