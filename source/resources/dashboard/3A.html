<h1>3A. Develop a detailed short-term work plan and timeline</h1>
<p>In the previous steps of the project cycle, your project team developed your general action,
monitoring, and operational plans. In this phase of the cycle, you need to turn these general
plans into more specific ones and then implement these plans on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>The first part of this step is to take your overall plans and work with your project team and
partners to develop a much more specific short-term <strong>work plan</strong> covering the next few months
or at most, year. This work plan uses your overall action, monitoring, and operational plans
to specify in much greater detail:</p>
<ul><li>What specific <strong>activities</strong> and <strong>tasks</strong> are required to complete each planned strategy,
monitoring step, or operational function</li>
<li>Who will be responsible for helping to complete each activity and task.</li>
<li>When will each task be undertaken and what will be the sequence of linked activities
and tasks, and</li>
<li>How much money and other resources will be needed to complete each activity and
task (see Step 3B for greater detail).</li></ul>
<p>Your work plan can be recorded in a table, Gantt chart, and/or project calendar.</p>
<p>Your detailed work plan will also provide you with the basis for developing a project timeline
or calendar. In some situations, your work plan will not only specify tasks and
responsibilities, it will also record in a calendar format when these tasks will happen. In
other situations, your timeline or calendar will be more implicit. It is important to develop
your timeline so that all project team members budget their time according to the project
needs.</p>
Outputs for this standard practice include:
<ul><li>Work plan detailing the tasks, activities, and responsibilities associated with your
Action Plan, Monitoring Plan, and Operational Plan</li>
<li>Project timeline or calendar.</li></ul>
