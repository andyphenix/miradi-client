<h1>4B. Analyze results</h1>
<p>One of the most important aspects of adaptive management is that it allows you to
systematically assess whether you are on track to achieve your stated goals and objectives.
Your monitoring data should provide you with the information needed to see whether you
have achieved your expected intermediate results and whether you are on track to achieve
long-term success. In addition, adaptive management also allows you to determine why
certain activities have succeeded or failed. Your monitoring data provide you with the
opportunity to see whether the core assumptions you laid out in the planning steps above hold
true in reality. By testing these core assumptions, you are in a better position to adapt and
change your project activities accordingly.</p>
<p>For learning and effective communication, it is important that the right people be involved in
the analyses and/or made aware of the results of the analyses. As a general rule, analyses
should involve members of the project team. However, input from outside experts or those
with other perspectives is valuable during the analyses of your monitoring results.</p>
<p>To check if you are on track or why something may have succeeded or failed, you should
undertake the following tasks:</p>
<ul><li>Consider your results in the context of your conceptual model and results chains;</li>
<li>Review your assumptions and assess if your assumptions are correct, if you are on track
to meet your goals and objectives and if your strategies are having the desired impact;</li>
<li>Assess the utility of your indicators; and</li>
<li>Determine if your goals and objectives were set at an appropriate level and if the
timeline for achieving them was appropriate.</li></ul>
<p>Depending on the type of data that you have and your information needs, these analyses can
range from formal statistical studies to simple qualitative assessments.
It is also important to consider whether the operational processes supporting your project are
functioning properly. You may have a project that uses the perfect strategies to address the
threats and opportunities affecting your conservation targets, but maybe your team is not
operating efficiently or it does not have the administrative or financial support it needs to do
its job well. </p>
Some questions you might want to explore during your analysis include:
<ul><li>To what extent do you have sufficient resources (e.g., financial, human, administrative,
political) to carry out your project?</li>
<li>To what extent do you have the physical infrastructure and equipment (e.g., office
space, vehicles, computers) you need to do your job?</li>
<li>To what extent does your project team operate smoothly or are there areas where you
could improve how the team functions? (e.g., communications, delegation of
responsibilities)</li></ul>
Outputs for this standard practice include:
<ul><li>Analyses of project results and assumptions.</li>
<li>Analyses of operational and financial data.</li>
<li>Documentation of discussions and decisions.</li></ul>
