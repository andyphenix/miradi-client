<P>Miradi 4.0 contains many improvements and enhacements.  In addition to lots of "behind the scenes" technical improvements, some major highlights include:

<UL>
  <LI><B>New Integrated .Miradi File Format</B> - Miradi 3.x stored data in sub-folders in the Miradi directory on your computer. If you wanted to transfer the file, you had to export an .mpz file. Now, project data are stored in your Miradi directory in one file that uses the .Miradi extension. You can treat these .Miradi files as you would any other file (e.g. .doc or .pdf) on your computer. Click <A 
href="https://miradi.org/files/Instructions_for_New_Miradi_File_Structure.pdf "><U><FONT 
color=#0000ff>here</U></FONT></A> for more details.</LI>

  <LI><B>Ability to Edit Directly in Upper Tables</B> - You can now edit any blue text that you see in tables without having to click on the lower panel.</LI>
  
  <LI><B>Support for Text Formatting</B> - You can now use the right (alt) mouse button to add text formatting (e.g. bold, italic) and hyperlinks to any multi-line text field.</LI>

<LI><B>Designate Task Leader</B> - You can now assign responsibility for leading an activity or task in work planning mode. You can also make work assignments from diagram view.</LI>

<LI><B>Support for XSLT Report Generation</B> - Miradi now supports the generation of custom reports using the XSLT language.</LI>

<LI><B>Support for Miradi Dashboard and Miradi Share Online Systems</B> - Miradi Desktop software is now designed to readily export information to the Miradi Dashboard application and the Miradi Share online system for managing conservation programs. See the <A
