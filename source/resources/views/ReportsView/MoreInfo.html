<H3>An Overview of Reports in Miradi</H3>
This view enables you to produce various reports about your project. Reports are only one of many ways to export your information from Miradi to other applications.<br>

<p>Miradi currently supports two types of reports:

<ul>
<li><b>Standard Reports - </b>These are pre-defined reports that produce documents in accordance with the CMP Open Standards. Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Full&nbsp;Project&nbsp;Report&gt;</code> button to create a document showing all of your project info; use the remaining buttons to create a document showing one section of your plan.</li><br>
<li><b>Custom Reports - </b>These are pre-defined reports that produce documents in accordance with the needs of a specific organization. Use the appropriate button to generate the report that you want. Contact us at <A href="mailto:support@miradi.org">support@miradi.org</A> if you would like to develop your own custom report.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you select one of the reports, Miradi will prompt you to specify where to save the RTF file.  RTF files (Rich Text Files) are compatible with most word processing programs includinng Micrsoft Word.  However, if you open this fie in Microsoft Word, you should save it as a .doc file type instead of the RTF.  Saving as an RTF can result in a large file size.</p>

<p class='hint'><b>Hint:</b> Changes made to the reports outside of Miradi will not be maintained the next time you generate a report. As a result, try to make the changes in the appropriate Miradi fields where possible.</p>
