To keep your model reasonably simple and to make it an effective communication tool, it is best to show only the most important links between direct threats and targets. If you have a direct threat that has a negligible impact on a target, you should consider not including that relationship in your model.

<p>Remember, building your model is as much an art as a science. It will not be perfect, but it should do a reasonable job of representing what is happening at your site.</p>
