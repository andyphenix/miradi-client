To start your monitoring plan, using your diagram, first look at the chains where you are taking action and thus need to measure <a href='Definition:StrategyEffectiveness' class='definition'>strategy effectiveness.</a> At a minimum, you will probably want to think about indicators for each goal and objective.  You may also want to think about other factors in the chain that you need to monitor.

<p>You should then consider any chains where you are not currently taking or planning
 to take action, but where you need to conduct 
<a href='Definition:StatusAssessments' class='definition'>status assessments</a> over time. In particular, you will probably want to think about monitoring key targets and direct threats.</p>
