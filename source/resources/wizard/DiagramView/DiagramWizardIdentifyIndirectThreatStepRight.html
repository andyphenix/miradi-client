<a href='Definition:IndirectThreat' class='definition'>Indirect threats</a> and <a href='Definition:IndirectThreat' class='definition'>opportunities</a> (collectively <i>contributing factors</i>) are the economic, cultural, political, legal, social, and/or institutional factors that drive direct threats.</p>

<p class='hint'><strong>Hint:</strong> We use the same shape to represent both indirect threats and opportunities because often, a given factor (for example tourism) can be both a threat and an opportunity.  Many people find it helpful to focus on neutral "factors" rather than trying to classify factors as being positive or negative.</p></div>
