Starting with Version 3.0, Miradi now provides an option to display <a href='Definition:HumanWelfareTargets' class='definition'> human welfare targets</a> alongside your focal conservation targets.

<p>If you want to use human welfare targets, you must first go to the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Edit/Preferences/Project Settings&gt;</code> menu and change the mode from <i>"Default Mode"</i> to <i>"Human Welfare Target Mode."</i> You will now have the ability to enter brown Human Welfare scope boxes and tan colored human welfare targets.</p>

<p class='hint'><strong>New Feature Hint:</strong> Human welfare targets have all the same properties as conservation targets except that you cannot assign them a habitat classification or a species Latin name. They also do not factor into viability roll-up calculations.</p>
