An <i>objective</i> is a formal statement detailing a desired outcome of a project, such as reducing a critical threat. If the project is well conceptualized and designed, realization of a project's objectives should lead to the fulfillment of the project's goals and ultimately its vision. A good objective meets the criteria of being:
          
<ul>
<li><strong>Outcome Oriented -</strong> Represents necessary changes in critical threat and opportunity factors that affect one or more project goals </li>          
<li><strong>Time Limited -</strong> Achievable within a specific period of time</li>          
<li><strong>Measurable -</strong> Definable in relation to some standard scale (numbers, percentage, fractions, or all/nothing states)</li>          
<li><strong>Specific -</strong> Clearly defined so that all people involved in the project have the same understanding of what the terms in the objective mean</li>          
<li><strong>Practical -</strong> Achievable and appropriate within the context of the project site   </li>          
</ul>			  

An <i>activity</> is an action that is carried out to accomplish one or more of a project's strategies. Activities should capture a discrete package of work that is assigned to one or more specific individuals to complete over a relatively short time frame. Each activity should be defined such that:

<ul>
<li>It has clearly identified beginning and end points</li>
<li>The time and cost needs can easily be estimated</li>
<li>Its progress and completion can be easily assessed</li>
<li>It is distinct from other activities.</li>
</ul>
