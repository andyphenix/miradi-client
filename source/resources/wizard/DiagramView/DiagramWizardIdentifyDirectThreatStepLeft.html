To insert a <a href='Definition:DirectThreat' class='definition'>direct threat</a>, select a target and then click the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Insert Direct Threat&gt;</code> button located on the Control Bar. The software will add a new direct threat linked to the target and open a dialogue box.

<!-- would be nice to have text wrap on left -->


<p>Type in the <strong>Name</strong> of your direct threat, and if desired, an <strong>ID</strong> (see hint below). You can also add additional information about the threat in the <strong>Details</strong> and/or <strong>Comments</strong> fields. If you plan to share your project with other people, you can also pick the entry that best describes your threat from the <strong>Standard Classification</strong> field that lists a taxonomy of all direct threats in the drop-down menu.</p>

<p>Once you close the dialogue box, using the mouse or arrow keys, move the threat to wherever you want it to be on the diagram.</p>

<p class='hint'><strong>Hint:</strong> The <strong>Direct Threat ID</strong> field can be used for a brief user-defined code used to identify and sort your direct threats. One common system is to assign the letters DT and a number to each Direct Threat (e.g., DT1, DT2, etc.)</p>

<p class='hint'><strong>Hint:</strong> In most Miradi dialogue boxes, the <strong>Details</strong> field is used to record a longer description of the factor, whereas the <strong>Comments</strong> field is meant for discussion about the factor.</p>
