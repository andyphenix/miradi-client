<P>Next, determine the <a href='Definition:DesiredFutureStatus' class='definition'>desired future status</a> for the indicator. In the upper table, click on the blue oval beneath the indicator you are working on and then edit the fields in the bottom panel.</P>
			
<P>For the selected indicator's desired future value, fill in the following fields:</P>
			
<LI><STRONG>Desired Future Value Date:</STRONG>&nbsp;The date at which the indicator value will be assessed.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Desired Future Value:</STRONG>&nbsp;The desired future value or summary qualitative description of the indicator.

<P>Miradi will automatically display the Future Status value, along with a blue oval icon, in the cell of the monitoring table corresponding to the desired future status.</P>

<p>If you want to use an existing indicator from another factor, click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Clone&nbsp;Indicator&gt;</code> button and follow the instructions. To edit or delete an indicator, click on the desired row and then either edit the text in the box at the bottom or click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Delete&nbsp;Indicator&gt;</code> button.</p>
