Draft strategies can be rated on the following criteria:

<p><strong>Potential Impact -</strong> If implemented, will the strategy lead to desired changes in the situation at your project site?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Very High</b> - The strategy is very likely to completely mitigate a threat or restore a target.</li>
<li><b>High</b> - The strategy is likely to help mitigate a threat or restore a target.</li>
<li><b>Medium</b> - The strategy could possibly help mitigate a threat or restore a target.</li>
<li><b>Low</b> - The strategy will probably not contribute to meaningful threat mitigation or target restoration.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that there are at least two dimensions being rolled up into this rating:  probability of positive impact and magnitude of change. The users will have to integrate these into their rating.</p>


<p><strong>Feasibility -</strong> Would your project team be able to implement the strategy within likely time, financial, staffing, ethical, and other constraints?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Very High</b> - The strategy is ethically, technically, AND financially feasible.</li>
<li><b>High</b> - The strategy is ethically and technically feasible, but may require some additional financial resources.</li>
<li><b>Medium</b> - The strategy is ethically feasible, but either technically OR financially difficult without substantial additional resources.</li>
<li><b>Low</b> -The strategy is not ethically, technically, OR financially feasible.</p></li>
</ul>

These ratings are then rolled-up to give an overall summary rating for the strategy.  Note that if a draft strategy is assigned any "red" colored rating, then the summary rating will also be "red."
