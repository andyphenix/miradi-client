The first step in building a conceptual model is to put your project <a href='Definition:Scope' class='definition'>scope</a> to one side (usually the far right) of your workspace.

<p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
To insert your scope, click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Insert Target&gt;</code> button in the Control Bar. The software will add a target to the page with a Project Scope box around it. You can select and drag the target to wherever you want it to be. You can then double-click on the green Project Scope box to either review the scope you entered earlier or enter a new scope statement. 
</td>
<td>
<table width='100%'><tr><td align='center'>
<img src='images/DiagramWizard/NewScope.png' width='115' height='78'></img>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p class='hint'><strong>Hint:</strong> In the current version of the Miradi software program, the scope is not a separate entity in the diagram, but instead is drawn automatically around all of your targets. You thus add your scope by adding a target to a blank diagram.</p>
