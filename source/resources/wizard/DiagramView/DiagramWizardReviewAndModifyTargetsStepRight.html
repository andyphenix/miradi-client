You should consider lumping targets if they:
<ul>
<li>Co-occur on the landscape,</li>
<li>Share common ecological processes,</li>
<li>Share similar critical threats, and</li>
<li>Therefore require similar conservation strategies.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand, if an aggregate target contains species or habitats 
that do not meet the above criteria, you may want to think about splitting it.</p>

<p>The decision to lump or split targets is as much an art as a science. You will have to use your judgment to determine what makes most sense for your site.<br></br>

<p class='hint'><strong>Hint:</strong> As a general rule, you should have no more than eight targets for your project.</p></div>
