Developing a results chain starts by taking the factors from the conceptual model. Both targets (green ovals) and strategies (yellow hexagons) look the same. But the other factors have shifted as shown in the following diagram.  In addition, the text of the direct threat and contributing factor boxes are now in brackets indicating that the text has not yet been converted from a factor to a result.

<p>To <b>convert your factors to results</b>, click on each box and edit the text. The key here is to transform the factor describing the current state of the world into the desired result.</p>
