An <i>indicator</i> is a measurable entity related to a specific information need, such as the status of a target, change in a threat, or progress towards an objective. Indicators can be quantitative measures or qualitative observations. Good indicators meet the following criteria:

<ul>
<li><strong>Measurable: </strong>Able to be recorded and analyzed in quantitative or in discreet qualitative terms.</li>
<li><strong>Clear: </strong>Presented or described in such a way that its meaning will be the same to all people.</li>  
<li><strong>Sensitive: </strong>Changing proportionately in response to actual changes in the condition or item being measured.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Methods</i> are specific techniques used to collect data to measure an indicator. A good method meets the criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accurate: </strong>The data collection method has little or no margin of error.</li>
<li><strong>Reliable: </strong>The results are consistently repeatable - each time that the method is used it produces the same result.</li>
<li><strong>Cost-Effective: </strong>The method does not cost too much in relation to the data it produces and the resources the project has.</li>
<li><strong>Feasible: </strong>The method can be implemented by people on the project team.</li>
<li><strong>Appropriate: </strong>Acceptable to and fitting within site-specific cultural, social, and biological norms.</li>
</ul>

<p>Methods do not need to be complex or sophisticated - if you can get the information you need using a simple, inexpensive method, it is far preferable to do this than to choose a complex, expensive method.  While the information you gather may be less precise, it may be sufficient for the types of decisions you are making. When planning for measuring results, you need to keep in mind that it should be a relatively small portion of your project budget. If your methods for measuring results are too complex, you will not have enough money to implement actions and measure the results.</p>
