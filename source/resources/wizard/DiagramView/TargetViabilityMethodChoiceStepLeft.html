Miradi currently supports two different viability analysis modes for assessing target status. Generally, within a project you should consistently use one mode or the other, but you can use different modes on different targets if you wish.

<p>To begin viability analysis on a target, bring up its properties dialog by double-clicking on the target oval in the diagram. Then click either the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Simple Mode&gt;</code> or <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Key Attribute Mode&gt;</code> buttons to indicate which method you would like to use for this target.</p>

<p>Once you return to this screen, you can repeat the viability analysis for another target. You can also click the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Done with Viability Analysis&gt;</code> button once you have completed viability analysis for all your targets and are ready to move on to the next step.</p>
