You have constructed your conceptual model in a series of separate steps. At this point, you should take a look at your model as a whole and ask yourself the following questions:

<ul>
<li>Does this model reasonably portray what is happening at my site?</li>
<li>Are all the key targets represented?</li>
<li>Are all the key direct threats represented?</li>
<li>Are all the key contributing factors (indirect threats and opportunities) represented?</li>
<li>Are the link arrows properly placed?</li>
<li>Have you verified that nothing major is missing?</li>
<li>Will the model be understandable to my project team?</li>
<li>Will the model be understandable to people outside of my project team?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you answered "yes" to all of these questions, <strong>Click the 'Next' button below to continue.</strong></p>

<p>If you answered "no" then you need to go back and fix your model.</p>
<p></p>
<p class='hint'><strong>Hint:</strong>Tags can be a powerful tool to help manage the visual complexity of a model.</p>

<p>To <b>employ tags</b>:
<ol>
<li>Click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Manage Tags&gt;</code> button on the toolbar.</li>
<li>Create one or more tags. They can be either related to a theme (e.g. all factors that are part of a specific chain), or a sequence in which you want the tagged items to appear (e.g. in an "animated" powerpoint). If you want to specify a sequence, it is also helpful to put numbers or letters in order in the ID field.</li>
<li>Returning to the diagram, hold the shift key down and select the factors that you want to apply a give tag to, and then use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Actions/Tag/Untag...&gt;</code> menu command, or the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Add Tag to Selected Items&gt;</code> command on the right (alt) click mouse  button to apply the tag.</li>
<li>Repeat with other tags as needed.</li>
<li>You can then use the check boxes in the control bar to set the visibility of each tag group.</li>
<li>Remember that once at least one tag is checked, then only checked tags will be visible. It is often helpful to create a tag called <b>Show All Factors</b> and assign it to all factors on the diagram so that you can rapidly bring them back without having to check and uncheck all the tags.</li></ol>
