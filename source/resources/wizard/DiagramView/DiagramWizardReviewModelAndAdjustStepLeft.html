You have constructed your conceptual model in a series of separate steps. At this point, you should take a look at your model as a whole and ask yourself the following questions:

<ul>
<li>Does this model reasonably portray what is happening at my site?</li>
<li>Are all the key targets represented?</li>
<li>Are all the key direct threats represented?</li>
<li>Are all the key contributing factors (indirect threats and opportunities) represented?</li>
<li>Are the link arrows properly placed?</li>
<li>Have you verified that nothing major is missing?</li>
<li>Will the model be understandable to my project team?</li>
<li>Will the model be understandable to people outside of my project team?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you answered "yes" to all of these questions, click the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Next&gt;</code> button below to continue.  
If you answered "no" then you need to go back and fix your model.</p>

<p><b>Conceptual Model Progress Report:</b> Note that you can now add a progress report to describe your conceptual model on a given date. 
Right-click on the conceptual model name in the control bar to bring up the Diagram Properties window.  Click the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Progress Report&gt;</code> side tab, 
and then click the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Create Progress Report&gt;</code> button to create a progress report.</p>

<p class='hint'><strong>Hint:</strong> Tags can be a powerful tool to help manage the visual complexity of a model.</p>

<p class='hint'><strong>New Feature Hint:</strong> Tags have been updated; here are the major changes:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>A checkbox has been added next to the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Manage Tags&gt;</code> button on the toolbar to “enable” the application of the tags.</b>  When this box is unchecked, all factors are displayed in the diagram.  When this box is checked, only factors with the checked tags are displayed.</li>
<li><b>The application of a tag to a factor is now diagram-specific.</b>  In the past, when a tag was applied to a target, it applied for every conceptual model and result chain that contained that target.  Now, checking a tag for a factor applies that tag only for the active diagram.  In migration from prior Miradi versions, all prior tag applications are retained, so conscientious taggers will likely want to cleanup their prior tag applications.</li>
<li><b>Only the tags that have been applied to factors in the active diagram are displayed in the list in the Control Bar.</b>  In the past, all tags were displayed in every diagram.</li>
<li><b>All menu options to add and remove tags have been modified to be diagram-specific.</b>  A “Remove All Tags” option has been added to the right-click context menu; this option clears all tags applied to the active diagram for one or more selected factors.  The “Remove Tag” option displays only the tags that have been applied for the selected factors for the active diagram, and clears the selected tag for the active diagram only.  The Add Tag options display all tags so that tags may be applied to diagrams for the first time. 
</ol> 

<p>To <b>employ tags</b>:
<ol>
<li>Click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Manage Tags&gt;</code> button on the toolbar.</li>
<li>Create one or more tags. They can be either related to a theme (e.g. all factors that are part of a specific chain), or a sequence in which you want the tagged items to appear (e.g. in an "animated" powerpoint). If you want to specify a sequence, it is also helpful to put numbers or letters in order in the ID field.</li>
<li>Returning to the diagram, hold the shift key down and select the factors that you want to apply a tag to, and then use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Actions/Tag/Untag...&gt;</code> menu command, or the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Add Tag to Selected Items&gt;</code> command on the right (alt) click mouse  button to apply the tag.</li>
<li>Repeat with other tags as needed.</li>
<li>You can then use the check boxes in the control bar to set the visibility of each tag group.</li>
<li>Remember that once at least one tag is checked, then only checked tags will be visible. </li>
</ol>
