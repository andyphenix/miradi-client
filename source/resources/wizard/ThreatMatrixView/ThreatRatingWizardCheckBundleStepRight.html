<strong>Target-Threat Rating - </strong>Miradi calculates threat ratings using a rule-based system for combining the scope, severity, and irreversibility criteria.  These procedures involve specifying rules as to how different parameters should be combined with one another. <a href='Definition:ShowRulesCalculations'>Click here</a> for a detailed description of this system.</font>
<p><strong>New Feature Hint:</strong> Direct threats do not need to be directly linked to targets to have target-threat ratings.  If, however, a target-threat combination should <strong>not</strong> be rated, click the <strong>N/A - not a direct link</strong> checkbox located next to the Target-Threat Rating.  Click the ? icon next to the checkbox for more information.</p>
