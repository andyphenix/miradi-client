<strong>Summary Threat Ratings - </strong>Miradi rolls up threat ratings for each target and threat using another rule-based system for combining ratings for each target-threat combination. <a href='Definition:ShowRulesBundles'>Click here</a> for a detailed description of this system.</p>

<p><strong>New Feature Hint:</strong> Direct threats do not need to be directly linked to targets to have target-threat ratings.  If, however, a target-threat combination should <strong>not</strong> be rated, click the <strong>N/A - not a direct link</strong> checkbox located next to the Target-Threat Rating.  Click the ? icon next to the checkbox for more information.</div>
