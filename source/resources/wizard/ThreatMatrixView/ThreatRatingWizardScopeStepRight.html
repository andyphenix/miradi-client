<strong>Scope - </strong> Most commonly defined spatially as the proportion of the target that can reasonably be expected to be affected by the threat within ten years given the continuation of current circumstances and trends. For ecosystems and ecological communities, measured as the proportion of the target's occurrence. For species, measured as the proportion of the target's population.

<ul>
<li><b>Very High:</b> The threat is likely to be pervasive in its scope, affecting the target across all or most 
(71-100%) of its occurrence/population.</li>
<li><b>High:</b> The threat is likely to be widespread in its scope, affecting the target across much 
(31-70%) of its occurrence/population.</li>
<li><b>Medium:</b> The threat is likely to be restricted in its scope, affecting the target across some 
(11-30%) of its occurrence/population.</li>
<li><b>Low:</b> The threat is likely to be very narrow in its scope, affecting the target across a small proportion 
(1-10%) of its occurrence/population.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Explanation of Key Terms</b></p>
The <i>target</i> refers to the focal conservation target at the scale being assessed - in technical terms, the target occurrence within the defined project area (e.g., small site, landscape, or even global scale). <i>Affected</i> means subject to one or more stresses from the threat. The <i>ten-year</i> time frame can be extended for some longer-term threats like global warming that need to be addressed today. <i>Current circumstances and trends</i> include both existing as well as potential new threats. <i>Occurrence</i> for ecosystems is typically by area. Species includes both single species targets as well as multiple species guilds. If a species is evenly distributed, then the proportion of the target's population is the same as the proportion of the area occupied, but if it is patchily distributed, then it is not. In these cases, it is important to specify the unit of assessment for the target (e.g., breeding pairs vs. nests vs. individuals).

<p>For both ecosystems and species, the proportion is estimated as the percentage of the target's occurrence at the scale being assessed (e.g. a water pollution threat affecting an aquatic ecosystem target is measured as the percentage of that aquatic ecosystem target affected, not the percentage of the area of the entire site).</p>
