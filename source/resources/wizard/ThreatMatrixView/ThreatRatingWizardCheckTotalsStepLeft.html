The table below contains a summary of your threat ratings.

<ul>
<li>The <strong>column on the far right </strong>contains a summary of the overall rating of each threat across all targets.</li>
<li>The <strong>row on the bottom </strong>contains a summary of the overall threat rating for each target.</li>
<li>Finally, the <strong>lowest right hand cell</strong> contains a summary of the threat rating for your entire project.</li>
</ul>

<p>These summary ratings are not entered directly, but are calculated as you rate the specific effects of threats on targets in the cells of the table.</p>

<p>You should check whether you agree with these summary ratings.  If any of them do not make sense, you may need to go back and adjust the ratings for the specific criteria.</p>
