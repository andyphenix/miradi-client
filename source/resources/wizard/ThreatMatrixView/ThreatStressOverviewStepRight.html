<H3>Guide to the Stress Based Threat Rating Summary Table</h3>

The <strong>far left hand column </strong>is a listing of all threats and the <strong>top row </strong>is a listing of all targets for your project. To <strong>sort the table, </strong>click on any cell in the header row to sort by that column.You can <strong>move</strong> or <strong>change the width </strong>of columns and <strong>change the height</strong> of rows.<p>The cells of the table show the overall threat ratings for each threat on each target that it affects.  You can click on a cell to see the details that go into its  threat ratings. To <strong>create a new link</strong> between a threat and target, right (alt) click on a blank cell in the table.

<p>Finally, the table contains three types of summary ratings:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>column on the far right </strong>contains a summary of the overall rating of each threat across all targets.</li>
<li>The <strong>row on the bottom </strong>contains a summary of the overall threat rating for each target.</li>
<li>Finally, the <strong>lowest right hand cell </strong>contains a summary of the threat rating for your entire project.</li></ul>

<p>These summary ratings are not entered directly, but are calculated as you rate the specific effects of threats on targets. Miradi calculates threat ratings using a rule-based system.   The scope and severity are used to calculate the magnitude, and the contribution and irreversibility criteria are combined to calculate a source rank.  The magnitude and source ranks are then used to calculate the summary stress rating and the summary stress ratings are then used to calculate the rank of a threat to a target which is what is displayed in the threat ratings table. <a href='Definition:ShowStressBasedRulesCalculations'>Click here</a> for a detailed description of how Miradi calculates the rank for a specific threat to a target, and <a href='Definition:ShowRulesBundles'>click here</a> for a detailed description of how Miradi calculates row and column totals.</p></div>
