Each <a href='Definition:Strategy' class='definition'>strategy</a> will have one or more 
<a href='Definition:Activity' class='definition'>activities</a> associated with it.

<p>In the Work Plan View, select the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Work&nbsp;Plan&gt;</code> 
tab and select a strategy that you want to focus on in the tree. Think about 
the specific activities that you will have to undertake to carry out this strategy.  Click on the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Create...&gt;</code> button and select <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Create&nbsp;Activity&gt;</code> and then type the name of the activity in the item field in the bottom panel. Repeat this for other activities needed to implement this strategy as needed.

<p>If necessary, you can also highlight an activity and click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Create...&gt;</code> button and select <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Create&nbsp;Task&gt;</code> to add <a href='Definition:Task' class='definition'>tasks</a> under this activity.  (If you are really detail oriented, you can even create sub-tasks and sub-sub tasks under tasks)</p>
