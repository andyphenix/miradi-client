<p>The <b>Analysis Tab</b> allows for the creation of more complex views of the budget data by grouping the expenses at various category levels.  
For instance, view which people are associated to a given funding source, or see how expenses break down among your accounting codes per funding source.  
These reports can then be exported as RTF or Tab delimited files for use in other accounting systems.</p>

<p class='hint'><b>Hint:</b> You can create individual work plans by using the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Filter&nbsp;by&nbsp;People...&gt;</code> button, 
and selecting the resources you want to view.  This will update the Work Plan to show work days and budget totals for only the selected people.</p>
