Some hints for working with your budget:

<P><strong>People costs</strong></P>
<p class='hint'><b>Hint:</b> If you have already added the Work Unit Rate for a person, at this point you should see the total cost for that person for the year (if planning by years) or for the quarter and rolled up for the year (if planning by quarters). 
The annual amount is then displayed in the table at the top of the page. Click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;People&gt;</code>&nbsp; tab, and select the person in the table if you need to edit the Work Unit Rate information.</p>

<p class='hint'><b>Hint:</b> To calculate a daily Work Unit Rate for People that are paid an hourly rate, you can multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours in the average/standard work day. For People that are paid a yearly salary, it is most common to divide the salary by 240, which is approximately how many work days there are in a standard work year.</p>

<p class='hint'><b>Hint:</b> In many organizations, salary levels for team members can be confidential. Be aware that, 
unless your project is managed within a Miradi Share program that redacts Work Unit Rates, all users of the file will have access to any salary information that is entered. 
One solution might be to use mid-points of published salary ranges. </p>

<p class='hint'><b>Hint:</b> Accounting Codes and Funding Sources are applied to person assignments and expenses - not at the higher action or person levels.  
Thus the same person may have different accounting codes or funding sources depending on their work in the various actions.  
To view the amount of work, expenses, and total budget amounts by person, accounting code or funding source, 
go to the respective <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;People&gt;</code>, <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Accounting Codes&gt;</code> or <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Funding Sources&gt;</code>&nbsp;tabs.</p>

<P><strong>Work Plan time horizon</strong></P>
<p class='hint'><b>Hint:</b> To set the work planning horizon for your project, go to the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Settings&gt;</code> tab in the Work Plan View (or go to Edit->Preferences, and select the Planning tab), and enter Work Plan Start and End Dates. 
Go to the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Financial Settings&gt;</code> side tab to adjust the currency type and the number of decimal places displayed.  

<p class='hint'><b>Hint:</b> If you have entered estimates for work or expenses, and then change the Work Plan start or end dates so that some of the estimates fall outside of the new planning time span, those estimates will no longer be displayed in the Work Plan table.  A warning message appears at the bottom left of the screen when such estimates are hidden.  Change the dates back to a time span that includes all entries to display all estimates; the warning message will then no longer appear.</p>
