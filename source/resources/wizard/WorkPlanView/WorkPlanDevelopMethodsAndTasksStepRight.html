<p>Activities and tasks are implemented by assigning <strong>people</strong> to them.
To add a new person, go to the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;People&gt;</code> tab in the Work Plan View. 
Click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Add&nbsp;People&gt;</code> button and the fill in the appropriate information below. 
You do not need to fill out all of the fields. The ID field should contain the initials 
of the person or a short reference to the position that they hold.

<p class='hint'><b>Hint: </b>People can be either an individual person or a group of people. 

<p class='hint'><b>Hint: </b>It is possible to create work estimates for activities and tasks without knowing the actual 
person who will perform them. Miradi will automatically assign the work to a "Not Specified" person. 
This can be helpful in helping you estimate required people. 
In some cases it might be helpful to create place holder positions like "Field Staff", 
assign work to that position and then edit the people details when you know who will actually perform that work.

<p class='hint'><b>Hint: </b>Work Units are typically estimated in number of days. (This is not required; some projects use weeks as the work unit.)  If you would prefer to do your estimates using the concept of Full Time Equivalents (FTEs), you can right click in any work units cell and select <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Fraction&nbsp;of&nbsp;FTE...&gt;</code> to bring up a calculator that will assist you in conversion of FTE values into days.

<p class='hint'><b>Hint: </b>You can also use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Leader&gt;</code> button on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;People&gt;</code> side tab to assign one person to be the leader of the action; the designated leader appears first in the upper column with an asterisk (*) by their name.
