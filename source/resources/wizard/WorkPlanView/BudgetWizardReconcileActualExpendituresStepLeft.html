Future versions of Miradi will allow you to generate reports on <a href='Definition:ActualExpenditures' class='definition'>actual expenditures</a> across different time periods by accounting code, activity, funding source, and against budgets.

<p>Currently, it is possible to review all work and expenses that have been assigned to a given Project Resource, Accounting Code or Funding Source for a given time period.  This should aid in your planning by helping to determine your Resource and Funding needs per fiscal quarter or year.</p>
<p class='hint'><b>Hint:</b>You can create individual work plans by using the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Filter&nbsp;Project&nbsp;Resources...&gt;</code> button and selecting the resources you want to view.  This will update the Work Plan to only show work days and budget totals for the selected resource(s).</p>
