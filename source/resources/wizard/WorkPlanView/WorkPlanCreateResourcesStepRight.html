A <i>resource</i> is a person or group that is needed to complete an activity/method or a task.  Miradi will be able to help you build a detailed budget for your project by calculating the cost for the estimated work that has been assigned to each resource.

<p class='hint'><b>Hint:</b>To calculate a Daily Rate for Project Resources that are paid an hourly rate, you can multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours in the average/standard work day.  For Project Resources that are paid a yearly salary, it is most common to divide the salary by 240, which is approximately how many work days there are in a standard American work year.</p>
