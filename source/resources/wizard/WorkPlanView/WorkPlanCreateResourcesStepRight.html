<p>Purple monitoring activities function in the same way as regular yellow activities, but are used to capture work specifically needed to implement project monitoring functions.</p>

<p>To create monitoring activities from the Work Plan view, first make sure that the table view includes Monitoring data by clicking 
the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Customize&nbsp;Table...&gt;</code> button and selecting either <b>Actions and Monitoring</b> or <b>Monitoring</b> from 
the <strong>Include Data From </strong> drop down menu.  Then select the strategy in the table that will have the new monitoring activity, 
click the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Create...&gt;</code> button, and select the <b>Create Monitoring Activity</b> option.
</p>

<p class='hint'><b>Hint: </b>To change a yellow activity to a purple monitoring activity, go to the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Lists&gt;</code> tab in the Strategic Plan view, 
and select the <b>Activities Only</b> table from the drop down menu.  Select the activity in the table that you want to change, and click the Monitoring Activity check box in the bottom panel.</p>

<p class='hint'><b>Hint: </b>You may want to create a separate results chain to capture the status monitoring activities that you implement to track the status of the targets and threats in your Conceptual Model.</p>
