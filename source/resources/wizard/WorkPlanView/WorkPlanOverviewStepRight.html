<h3>Hints for the Work Plan View</h3>
<p>You can specify which Conceptual Model or Results Chain diagram to display in the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Work&nbsp;Plan&gt;</code> tab 
by selecting from the <strong>Diagrams - include data from </strong> and the  <strong>Display this selection </strong> drop down choosers.    
The work plan table will display the strategies, activities and tasks from the strategies that are in the selected diagram(s).</p>

<p>You can also specify whether to display only Action rows (strategies and yellow activities) or Monitoring rows (strategies and purple monitoring activities) 
by clicking the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Customize&nbsp;Table...&gt;</code> button and making a selection in the <strong>Include Data From </strong> drop down menu.  
The project totals values will only reflect the data that is being displayed.</p>

<p>Click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Work&nbsp;Plan&gt;</code> tab to <strong>see an overview of your plan.</strong>  In the tree, clicking on the + and - symbols 
enables you to <strong>expand</strong> or <strong>collapse</strong> different parts of the hierarchy.
Click the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Expand&nbsp;To...&gt;</code> button to select the branches of the tree to display.   
To display the <strong>Assignment</strong> and <strong>Expense</strong> rows, click 
the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Customize&nbsp;Table...&gt;</code> button, and check the appropriate Rows check boxes.</p>

<p>Expenses are estimated in the default project currency.  To set the currency, go to the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Settings&gt;</code> tab in the Work Plan View (or go to Edit->Preferences, and select the Planning tab). Select the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Financial Settings&gt;</code> side tab to adjust the currency type and the number of decimal places displayed.</p>

<p class='hint'><b>Hint: </b>The values in the  <strong>Who Work Assignments</strong> column roll up from lower levels in the hierarchy so that it is easy to see all the people that will be required for a given strategy or activity.
<p class='hint'><b>Hint: </b>The values in the <strong>Timeline</strong> column are entered from the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Timeline&gt;</code> side tab in the sub-panel of an action, and are independent of the Work Unit or Expense entries in the Work Plan table.   
<p class='hint'><b>Hint: </b>The values in the <strong>When Work Assignments</strong> column are based on the Work Unit entries in the Work Plan table.
