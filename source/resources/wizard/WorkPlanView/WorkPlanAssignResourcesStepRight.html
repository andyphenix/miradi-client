<h3>Functions of the Work Plan Tab</h3>
The Work Plan tab in the Work Plan view introduces a temporal grid as the primary working area.  There are three groups of columns:
<UL>
<LI><strong>Work Units:</strong> This group of columns is used to enter the amount of work, entered as a number of days that will be required to implement a strategy or indicator.</li>
<LI><strong>Expenses:</strong> This group of columns contains expenses, entered as dollars (or your preferred currency).  This is typically used to estimate the cost of non human resources for the project.</li>
<LI><strong>Budget Totals:</strong> This group of columns is read only.  They will display the calculated total cost for the work and expenses that have been assigned to your project.
</UL>
<p>All column groups can be expanded and collapsed by clicking on the plus/minus icons in the header row.  This will allow you to view and enter work and expense estimates at whatever granularity of time you prefer: Project Total, Years, Quarters, Months and even specific Days.</P>
<p class='hint'><b>Hint:</b>You can control which groups of columns are displayed by clicking the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Edit&nbsp;Customize&nbsp;Table...&gt;</code> button and checking/unchecking the groups.
