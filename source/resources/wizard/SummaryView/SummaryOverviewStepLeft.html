<h3>Welcome to the Miradi Interview & the Summary View!</h3>

As you go through the steps in the <A 
href="http://www.ConservationMeasures.org"><U><FONT 
color=#0000ff>CMP Open Standards</U></FONT></A>, this leftside panel of the interview will provide you with step-by-step instructions. The rightside panel will provide definitions and guidance.

<p>The <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Project&gt;</code> tab below provides an overview of your <a href='Definition:Project' class='definition'>project</a>. You can fill in your <b>Project Name</b> and set the <b>Primary Project Data Language</b> and the <b>Project Data Effective Date</b> (the date of your most recent substantive updating of the Miradi project file).</p>

<p>Miradi is now enhanced by <b>Miradi Share</b>. Click on the "Learn about Miradi Share" link or 
go to <A href="https://www.miradishare.org"><U><FONT
color=#0000ff>www.miradishare.org</U></FONT></A> to find out more about this online tool that greatly extends the capability of Miradi Software.</p>

<p>Click the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Next&gt;</code> button to define your initial project team.</p>

<p>Later on, you can return to this page and fill in the remaining fields:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Project Number</b> field can be used for any numbering system your organization uses.</li> 
<li><b>Related Projects</b> can be used to describe other sibling or parent projects.</li>          
<li><b>Project Website</b> is where you can put your project's website address.</li>          
<li><b>Project Description</b> can be used for a summary or abstract of your project.</li>          
<li><b>Program Classifications</b> are used with Miradi Share to tag your project with key info.</li>     
</ul>

<p>The <b>Progress Report</b> fields can be used to update the progress of your project on a certain date. 
Click the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Progress Report&gt;</code> side tab, 
and then click the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Create Progress Report&gt;</code> button to create a progress report with the following fields:
<ul>
<li><b>Project Status</b> can be used to generally describe how your project is doing at the moment.</li>    
<li><b>Next Steps</b> can be used to describe any critical next steps; this field is especially useful when you want to send your project file to other team members.</li>     
<li>Finally, the <b>Lessons Learned</b> field can be used to describe any key learnings.</li>      
</ul>
Miradi will display the most recent progress report data on the main Summary side tab.</p>


<p class='hint'><b>Hint:</b> Note that <b>Project Filename</b> is read only as shown by the grey background. To change what appears in this field, you have to rename the project file itself. This can be done from the initial Welcome (No-Project) page.</p>

<p class='hint'><b>Hint:</b> The <b>External Project IDs</b> field is another read only field used by external databases such as Miradi Share.</p>
