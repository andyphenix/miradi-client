The&nbsp;next step is to determine the <a href='Definition:Measurement' class='definition'>measurement</a> for each indicator.

<P>Select an indicator in the table and then click the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Create Measurement&gt;</code> button. Next in the bottom panel, fill in the following fields:</P>

<ul>
<LI><STRONG>Measurement Date:</STRONG>&nbsp;The date of the most recent indicator measurement. 
<LI><STRONG>Measurement Value:</STRONG>&nbsp;The current value or summary qualitative description of the indicator.
<LI><STRONG>Detail:</STRONG>&nbsp;Full description of the current value or qualitative description of the indicator.
<LI><STRONG>Current Status:</STRONG>&nbsp;The rating (VG, G, F, P) that corresponds to the measurement.
<LI><STRONG>Trend:</STRONG> Your assessment of the direction that this indicator is heading at the moment of the current measurement.
<LI><STRONG>Source:</STRONG>&nbsp;Your confidence rating in the source of the indicator measurement.
<LI><STRONG>Comments:</STRONG>&nbsp;Discussion about the measurement.</ul>

<P>Miradi will automatically shade in the cell of the indicator ratings table in the upper table with the color corresponding to your current status assessment (but it will NOT automatically read the measurement parameter and assign a current status category).&nbsp;It will also display an arrow showing the trend, and the current status label.</P>

<p>Miradi will calculate a status rating for each KEA, based on the ratings of its indicators. The KEA ratings will be rolled up for each KEA type, and the average of the KEA type status ratings will be used as the viability status rating for the target. This target viability status rating will appear at the top of the properties dialog, and will be displayed in the diagram as a small oval next to the target.</p>
