For Simple viability analysis, expand the table to the Target level and then select the target that you want to work on.  Make sure the Viability Mode field is set to "Simple". 

<p>Next, select the Status side tab and then use the drop down box in the <strong>Target Viability Status</strong> field to assign a status rating for the target. This rating will appear at the top of the properties dialog, and will be displayed in the diagram as a small oval next to the target. You should also select the Details side tab and fill out the <strong>Current Status Justification</strong> field with any information about how you arrived at this rating.
</p>
<p>
Goals and indicators for this target will be identified and added later.
