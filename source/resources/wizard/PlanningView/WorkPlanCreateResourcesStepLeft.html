Activities/methods and tasks are implemented by assigning <a href='Definition:Resource' class='definition'>resources</a> to the task in the lower panel of the screen.

<p>To create a new resource, go to the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Resources&gt;</code> 
 tab at the top of the Planning View. Click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Create&nbsp;Resource&gt;</code> button at the side of the page and the fill in the appropriate information below. For human resources, you will want to fill out all of the fields.  The Resource ID field should contain the initials of the person or a short reference to the position that they hold. Not all fields will apply to non-human resources - for example, most material resources will not have a phone number.</p>

<p>To edit an existing resource, select the resource in the table and then edit the text below. To delete a resource, select the resource in the table and click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Delete&nbsp;Resource&gt;</code> button at the side of the page.</p>

<p class='hint'><b>Hint:</b> Some of the fields in the lower panel may not apply to all kinds of resources. For example, some material resources may not have a first name. You should just leave fields blank as needed. However, also note that some material resources - for example equipment rented from a store - might actually have a phone number or other contact information associated with it.</p>
