<h3>Welcome to the Strategic Plan View</h3>

This view enables you to develop and edit various plans for your project.  
Specific subviews include:

<p><b>Action Plan</b> - A plan for how your project will change the project situation. Primarily derived from results chains and shows the relationship between a project's 
<a href='Definition:Goal' class='definition'>goals</a>, 
<a href='Definition:Objective' class='definition'>objectives</a>, and 
<a href='Definition:Strategy' class='definition'>strategies</a>.</p>

<p><b>Monitoring Plan</b> - A plan for collecting information that you and others need to know about your project. 
Primarily derived from results chains and includes the 
<a href='Definition:Indicator' class='definition'>indicators</a> 
that you will track over time as well as the 
<a href='Definition:Method' class='definition'>methods</a> 
that you will use.</p>

<p>
<b>Lists (Goals Only, etc.)</b> - Shows all of your 
<a href='Definition:Goal' class='definition'>goals</a>, 
<a href='Definition:Objective' class='definition'>objectives</a>, 
<a href='Definition:ConservationTargets' class='definition'>targets</a>,
<a href='Definition:DirectThreat' class='definition'>direct threats</a>,
<a href='Definition:Strategy' class='definition'>strategies</a>,
<a href='Definition:Activity' class='definition'>activities</a>,
<a href='Definition:Indicator' class='definition'>indicators</a>, 
<a href='Definition:Method' class='definition'>methods</a>, or 
<a href='Definition:AssignedResource' class='definition'>assigned resources</a> 
in one table for quick comparisons and editing.</p>

<p>
<b>Custom Views</b> - In addition to the standard planning views, Miradi also enables you to create your own custom planning views by choosing which objects to display in the rows and columns of the planning table.  This can be a good utility for creating custom report views.</p>


<p class='hint'><strong>New Feature Hint:</strong>In Miradi 3.0, the former Planning View has been split into the Strategic and Work Plan views and has been dramatically improved.</p>
