Each <a href='Definition:Strategy' class='definition'>strategy</a> will have one or more 
<a href='Definition:Activity' class='definition'>activities</a> associated with it.

<p>In the Planning View, click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Work Plan&gt;</code> 
radio button and select a strategy that you want to focus on in the tree. Think about 
the specific activities that you will have to undertake to carry out this strategy.  Click on the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Create&nbsp;Activity&gt;</code> button to add a new activity and then type the name of the activity in the item field in the bottom panel.  Repeat for other activities for this strategy as needed.  You can use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Move&nbsp;Item&nbsp;Up&gt;</code> and the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Move&nbsp;Item&nbsp;Down&gt;</code> buttons to change the order.</p>

<p>If necessary, you can also highlight an activity and click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Create&nbsp;Task&gt;</code> button to add <a href='Definition:Task' class='definition'>tasks</a> under this activity.  (If you are really detail oriented, you can even create sub-tasks and sub-sub tasks under tasks!)</p>
