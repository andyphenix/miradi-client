Miradi Share is a web-based software system that helps organizations adaptively manage portfolios of conservation projects and grants.<br/> 
Miradi Share builds on Miradi desktop software’s tools for designing, managing and monitoring individual conservation projects using <br/>
The Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation. In particular, Miradi Share enables sibling projects within an overall program to <br/>
build their individual plans using a common framework and vocabulary and to work collaboratively over the web. With Miradi Share, <br/>
program managers can track and oversee the implementation of all the projects for which they are responsible, and can roll-up project <br/>
information to compile performance reports to drive management decisions. And through Miradi Share, practitioners throughout the <br/>
conservation community can share experiences and learn from one another. Miradi Share also provides a platform for new tools like <br/>
online workplanning, archetypal results chains, and spatial analysis of Open Standards information.
<br/>
<br/>
All Miradi desktop users will be able to upload and share an individual project or browse through and download publically available<br/> 
projects for free. Miradi Share’s portfolio management tools are available through a software-as-a-service license.
