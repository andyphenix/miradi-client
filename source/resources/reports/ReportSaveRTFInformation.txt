RTF files can be read by MS Word, Open Office Writer, and 
other word processors. 

Unfortunately, the RTF files produced by this export process 
have some significant limitations. Notably, tables are exported 
as text boxes plus graphical lines, rather than as a true table. 
This makes it difficult to make significant edits.

Instead of exporting to RTF, we recommend that you use the ODT 
format, after downloading a free copy of Open Office Writer from:
