An external error prevented Miradi from writing some project data. 
The project should be fine, although your most recent
change may not have been saved. 
<br>
<br>

The most common common cause is a conflict with some backup or anti-virus
software running in the background. If this error recurs, please
either avoid using Miradi while this background process is running, or
re-schedule the background process so it doesn't run when you are using
Miradi. We hope to address these conflicts in future versions of Miradi.
<br>
<br>

This error could also be caused by permissions problems, such as if the 
project directory is made readonly while the project is open. Or by 
opening a file inside the Miradi data directory with another application. 
<br>
<br>

<b>Miradi will now exit.</b>
