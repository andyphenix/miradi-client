An error prevented Miradi from reading or writing some project data. 
The project should be fine, although your most recent
change may not have been saved. Miradi will now exit.

This error is usually caused by a conflict with backup or anti-virus
software running in the background. If this error happens again, please
either avoid using Miradi while this background process is running, or
re-schedule the background process so it doesn't run when you are using
Miradi.

We hope to address these conflicts in future versions of Miradi.
