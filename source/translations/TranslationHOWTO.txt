This unix command will extract a .pot file from java source code.
It should be used after any string is added, removed, or modified:
  cd translations
  xgettext --language=java --keyword=EAM.text \
          --copyright-holder=Benetech --output=miradi.pot `find .. -name "*.java"`

Once-per-language command to create an initial .po file from the .pot template:
  cd translations
  msginit --input=miradi.pot --output-file=xx/miradi_xx.po --locale=xx
  
(where xx is the language such as 'fr' or 'es', possibly followed by an 
underline, then a locale country/region code such as US or CA.)
Then, update the header comments at the top of the generated .po file as appropriate.

Periodically, refresh each .po file to include new entries from the .pot:
  cd translations
  msgmerge --update --backup=simple xx/miradi_xx.po miradi.pot

Per-build, per-language command to convert a .po file to a .properties bundle:
  cd translations
  msgcat --properties-output --output-file xx/LocalizedText.properties xx/miradi_xx.po
  

  
RULES FOR TRANSLATORS TO LIVE BY:

1. Never edit the .pot file, because your changes will be erased next time
xgettext is run.

2. Use \n to insert hard newlines.

3. Delete "obsolete" entries which appear at the bottom of a .po file, commented-out.

4. Search the .po file for fuzzy entries, indicated with: 
      #, fuzzy
   For each of them, review the translation, fix if necessary, and delete the 
   fuzzy indicator comment line.
   
5. Always use UTF-8.

6. Entries that have a msgid containing vertical bars (|) typically have a 
category, followed by the bar, followed by the text that will actually be shown.
Only translate the portion of the text after the final vertical bar.
