Gather all requirements<br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Design the entire system<br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Write the code for the application<br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Test and debug the entire&nbsp;application<br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Deploy the application which will now work<br></br></P><P dir=ltr>Even at the time, this \"waterfall\" method of programming - so named because once you&nbsp;complete one step, there is no going back to it -&nbsp;seemed like a difficult thing to do.&nbsp;We weren't sure exactly what we wanted the program to do, so it seemed hard to design the entire system.</P><table><tr><td><P>When we met with the Benetech team, they told us about a relatively new programming method called <STRONG>Agile Development</STRONG>, typified by a specific process know as <STRONG>Extreme Programming (XP)</STRONG>.<STRONG>&nbsp;</STRONG>As outlined in the following diagram, Agile Development involves going through an iterative process of defining user stories (things that people want the software to do), writing modules of code in weekly iterations, testing these iterations, and then using the results to refine both the code and your list of stories.</P><P>Light bulbs started going off&nbsp;-&nbsp;here in the world of software was&nbsp;the same adaptive management approach that we have been advocating in conservation!!&nbsp;And interestingly, it has evolved for the same reason - a need to make decisions in the face of complexity and uncertainty.&nbsp;There is no way two years ago that we could have predicted that we would need many of the features that are in the current release of the software - we could only arrive at them through a systematic, iterative process.</P></td><td width='410'><img src='images/Umbrella/agileProgrammingCycle.png' width='406' height='307'></img></td></tr></table><P dir=ltr>Just as adaptive management is not a license to do \"whatever you want,\" but instead must carefully state your assumptions and then deliberately&nbsp;test them, so too Agile Programming requires a disciplined approach.&nbsp;We the users can suggest any stories we want.&nbsp;But the engineers will then log them into our tracking system and provide estimates of how much programming time will be required to complete each step.&nbsp;We then meet with the engineers before each weekly iteration to collectively&nbsp;decide what stories we will do that week, trying to get the most \"user value\" for that week's worth of engineering time.&nbsp;We users also then have to make sure that we test and provide feedback on the results of that weeks' iteration.</P><P>We're not sure that this agile process would work with a much larger project requiring dozens of programmers versus the handful that we worked with.&nbsp;And it is obviously clearly dependent on having software engineers who&nbsp;are deeply skilled, enthusiastically willing to keep changing things, able to dive in and rapidly get up to speed on new subject material, ask intelligent questions, be problem solvers, and make substantial contributions to design and function elements that enrich submitted stories as well as produce new stories.&nbsp;But&nbsp;with those caveats, the agile process&nbsp;seems to work really well.&nbsp; </P><P dir=ltr>So why are we providing you with all this navel gazing about our development process?&nbsp;There are two important messages we wish to convey.</P><P dir=ltr>1.&nbsp; <STRONG>We&nbsp;Need Your Stories</STRONG>&nbsp;- Because we are using Agile Programming, we collectively have the power to change whatever we want in this software program.&nbsp;If you the user find something minor that bothers you (when you click on a factor, the wrong thing is selected) or have a grand idea of how to improve the software (adding an entire&nbsp;module that does....), you should know that we can make it happen.&nbsp;Drop us a note at <A href=\"mailto:feedback@miradi.org\">feedback@miradi.org</A>.&nbsp;We won't guarantee that we will satisfy all requests.&nbsp;But we will certainly consider it - and at least get back to you to discuss it with you.</P><P dir=ltr><STRONG>2.&nbsp; Agile Programming / Adaptive Management Works</STRONG> - Although we are preaching the gospel of&nbsp;Adaptive Management in conservation, we (as of yet) still only have a limited number of stories showing that this approach adds value.&nbsp;Our experiences with Agile Programming have left us convinced that in the face of uncertainty and complexity, a flexible and yet deliberate iterative approach is the only way to go.&nbsp;We can't imagine undertaking another software program any other way - and it give us faith that we are on the right track in conservation too.<BR></P><p></p><HR><H3 dir=ltr>B.&nbsp; The Engineer's Perspective</H3><p>Agile software development has been around for decades, but was only recognized and named a few years ago. In 2001, practitioners of so-called \"lightweight\" methodologies got together and created the <a href='http://www.agilemanifesto.org/'>Agile Manifesto</a>. Since then, Agile development has continued to gain popularity and credibility, especially for projects with fewer than ten developers.</p><p>Shifting to <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_programming'>Agile Programming</a> from a more traditional methodology can be very challenging. Users take on more responsibility for prioritizing, and are expected to remain actively involved throughout the entire development cycle.Programmers have to let go of the idea that everything can be planned up front, and be willing to change direction as required. In order for that to be possible, the source code must always be kept clean and simple, and most agile projects use extensive automated tests to ensure high quality.</p><p>Extreme Programming (XP) is one specific form of Agile development. It is so famous that some people think that all Agile development must be \"extreme\". XP can work well, but it is very difficult to implement successfully, and is not appropriate for all teams or projects.For Miradi, we used a subset of XP that is also a variant of the<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Clear_%28software_development%29'>Crystal Clear</a> methodology.</p><p>For us, the benefits of Agile Programming include:<ul><li>Early delivery of working software</li><li>Responsiveness to changing requirements</li><li>Low defect counts</li><li>Efficient use of funds</li><li>Avoiding end-of-cycle \"death marches\"</li><li>Continuous learning and improvement</li><li>More fun!</li></ul></BODY></HTML>"

In recent years, there has been great convergence among conservation organizations in thinking about how best to plan, implement, and assess conservation actions in the context of a project cycle.</P><P>Making the most of the extensive, trial-and-error experience gained by conservation organizations while designing, implementing and appraising their conservation projects,&nbsp;the members of the Conservation Measures Partnership (CMP)&nbsp;have developed a set of project cycle or adaptive management open standards that are reflected in the work of all of our organizations and are, we believe, fundamental to effective conservation. These <EM>Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation</EM> are less a recipe that must be followed exactly than a framework and guidance for conservation action.</P><table border='0'><tr><td valign='top'><P><br>Our goal in developing these <EM>Open Standards</EM> is to bring together common concepts, approaches, and terminology in conservation project design, management, and monitoring in order to help practitioners improve the practice of conservation. In particular, these standards are meant to provide the principles, tasks, and guidance necessary for the successful implementation of conservation projects. As members of CMP, we hope that by developing these open standards, our colleagues in our respective organizations - and across the conservation landscape - will have clear guidance on how to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of their projects for maximum conservation gain. In addition, we anticipate that these standards will comprise the foundation of a useful conservation audit process.</p><br><p>We have organized the main ingredients of these open standards - principles, tasks, and guidance - into seven steps that comprise the project management cycle including conceptualization, planning, implementation, analysis, adaptation, communication, and iteration (go to <A href=\"http://www.ConservationMeasures.org\"><U><FONT color=#0000ff>www.ConservationMeasures.org</U></FONT></A> to download the full version of the standards). Although we present the standards as a linear series of steps or stages, the entire process is rarely applied in a linear fashion from start to finish - instead it is typically only a rough approximation of the more complex series of back-and-forth movements that a project goes through.</P></td><td width='410'><IMG hspace=20 src=\"images/standards/cmp-cycle2-1-400.png\" width=350 height=321 align=right vspace=20 border=0></td></tr></table><P>&nbsp; <HR><H3>The <EM>Open Standards</EM> in Miradi</H3><P>These <EM>Open Standards</EM>&nbsp;provide the basis for the Step-by-Step interview in the Miradi Software.&nbsp; The following table lays out the basic principles and tasks for each step of the <EM>Open Standards.&nbsp; </EM></P><P><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>CMP&nbsp; Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation, Version 2.0<BR></STRONG><FONT size=2>Tasks that are currently covered by the current version of the Miradi Software are shown in <FONT color=#0000ff>blue text</FONT>.</FONT></FONT></P><IMG src=\"images/standards/standardstable.png\" width=893 height=543><p></p><HR><H3 align=left>&nbsp; The Relationship Between the CMP<EM> Open Standards</EM> and Organizational-Specific&nbsp;Versions</H3><P align=left>The members of the Conservation Measures Partnership (CMP) each have their own organizational version of the CMP <EM>Open Standards.&nbsp;</EM>There is a long and complex history of exchange between these organizational versions and the CMP \"generic\" version of these standards.&nbsp;For example, The Nature Conservancy started with its 5-S process in the 1990s.&nbsp;Similarly, Foundations of Success staff published the <EM>Measures of Success</EM> approach around the same time. WWF and WCS, by contrast, had no one set of standards; instead each office had its own version.</P><P align=left>The CMP <EM>Open Standards </EM>were initially developed by bringing together commonalities across these different versions into Version 1.0 of the <EM>Open Standards.</EM>&nbsp; However, at that point, WWF then took this Version 1.0 and refined it to meet their needs, developing the <EM>WWF Project and Programme Standards</EM> shown below.&nbsp;Similarly, TNC took their 5-S process and refined it to&nbsp;fit the <EM>Open Standards</EM>, producing the <EM>TNC Conservation Action Planning (CAP)&nbsp;Approach</EM> shown below. And the WCS Living Landscapes Program developed their own version of the&nbsp;project cycle shown below.&nbsp;The CMP the evaluated the changes made by WWF, TNC, FOS, WCS&nbsp;and others, and used them to produce Version 2.0 of the <EM>Open Standards</EM> that reflect what has been learned from these experiences. As a result, each organization has a version of the standards that meets their specific needs, but at the same time, all can learn from one another.&nbsp; A further benefit is that members of each organization can use Miradi Software in their work with only minimal \"translation\" being needed.</P><P align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG src=\"images/standards/tnc-cycle-300h.png\" width=343 height=300 align=left vspace=20>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG height=300 src=\"images/standards/wwf-cycle-300h.png\" width=304 align=right vspace=20></P><P align=center><IMG height=300 src=\"images/standards/cmp-cycle1-2-300h.png\" width=327 align=middle></P><P align=center><IMG height=300 src=\"images/standards/mos-cycle-300h.png\" width=278 align=right><IMG height=300 src=\"images/standards/wcs-cycle-300h.png\" width=415 align=left></P>"

The network of funders supporting the work of conservationists is also quite extensive and includes individual donors, private foundations, and organizations such as the U.N., World Bank, bilateral aid organizations, and government bodies at all levels. While biodiversity conservation practitioners have made significant advances in recent years, they face several challenges related to the adaptive management of their projects (see section on adaptive mangement for a definition of this concept):</P><UL>  <LI><STRONG>Designing and Implementing Effective Actions</STRONG> \x2013 In the   face of growing threats and limited resources, practitioners need to be able   to understand the context they are working in, select the actions that will   give the highest returns on their investments, and implement these actions in   an effective and efficient fashion.   <LI><STRONG>Measuring and Documenting Impact</STRONG> \x2013 In light of the   increased demand for accountability among private donors, governments and the   general public, practitioners need to be able to measure and document the   effectiveness of their actions. This is a particular challenge because   conservation projects operate amid tremendous complexity and over long time   scales. Since most projects have multiple managers and donors that they report   to, each with their own unique reporting format, this reporting process also   consumes valuable project staff time and resources.   <LI><STRONG>Promoting Collaborative Learning</STRONG> \x2013 Meeting the previous   two challenges is hampered by the traditional lack of collaboration among the   major practitioners. This absence of cooperation has led to the proliferation   of multiple planning frameworks and conservation terminologies that have made   communication between groups even more difficult. As a result, there is   significant duplication of effort among practitioners and little knowledge   regarding which practices are most effective and which are not. Practitioners   need to be able to learn from their successes and failures and to share what   they have learned with others.</LI></UL><P>Recognizing these problems and their adverse impact on the practice of conservation, a number of leading conservation organizations have come together to form a consortium known as the Conservation Measures Partnership (CMP). To achieve its goal of improving the practice of conservation, the CMP is developing and promoting common standards and tools for planning, implementation and measuring conservation impact. Each organization within CMP has biodiversity conservation as its primary goal, has a focus on field-based conservation actions and is working to develop better approaches to project design, management, and assessment. CMP Core Members include: the African Wildlife Foundation (AWF), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and the Worldwide Fund for Nature/ World Wildlife Fund (WWF). Collaborating Members include: the Cambridge Conservation Forum, Conservation International (CI),&nbsp;Enterprise Works Worldwide, Foundations of Success, IUCN, RARE Center, and the World Commission on Protected Areas. </P><P>The CMP members have come together to work on issues related to project design, impact assessment, and learning because they believe that, collectively, they have a greater chance of making significant progress on designing and implementing effective adaptive management systems. More information about the CMP and its initiatives is available at <A href=\"http://www.conservationmeasures.org\">www.conservationmeasures.org</A></P><P>&nbsp;</P>"

Some believe adaptive management simply involves trying something and if it does not work, using common sense to adapt and try something else. While adaptive management requires common sense, it is not a license to try whatever one wants. </p><p>Instead, adaptive management requires an explicitly experimental \x2013 or \"scientific\" \x2013 approach to project management. As described by Salafsky et al. (2002), as&nbsp;shown in the diagram below, \"if&nbsp;one were to define a&nbsp;spectrum with pure research at one end and pure practice at the other, then adaptive management would be in the center.Pure researchers seek to understand the world and are successful if knowledge increases, regardless of what happens to the system they are studying.&nbsp;Pure practitioners&nbsp;seek to change the world but do not invest effort in trying to understand the system in which they are working.&nbsp;Adaptive managers attempt to reconcile these viewpoints: they want to change the world and achieve a defined goal, but they are also willing to invest effort in systematically learning about whether their actions work or do not work and why.\"</P><table width='100%'><tr><td align='center'><IMG height=181 alt=\"\" hspace=20 src=\"images/Umbrella/practice_knowledge-s.png\" width=420 align=left vspace=20 border=0></img></td></tr></table><P>Adaptive management&nbsp;can thus be defined as&nbsp;\"the integration of design, management, and monitoring to systematically test assumptions in order to adapt and learn\" (Salafsky, Margoluis, &amp; Redford, 2001).&nbsp;This definition can be expanded by looking at its three components:</P><UL>  <LI><STRONG>Testing</STRONG> <STRONG>assumptions</STRONG> is about   systematically trying different actions to achieve a desired outcome. It is   not, however, a random trial-and-error process. Instead, it involves   strategically choosing actions and explicitly outlining the assumptions about   how those actions will help achieve project goals and objectives. Teams then   monitor the actual results to see how they compare to the ones predicted by   their assumptions. The key is to develop an understanding of not only which   actions work and which do not, but also why.</LI></UL><UL>  <LI><STRONG>Adaptation</STRONG> is about using monitoring results to improve a   project. If project actions did not achieve the expected results, it is   because the project assumptions were wrong, the actions were poorly executed,   the conditions at the project site have changed, the monitoring was faulty \x2013   or some combination of these problems. Adaptation involves changing   assumptions and interventions to respond to the new information obtained   through monitoring efforts.</LI></UL><UL>  <LI><STRONG>Learning</STRONG> is about systematically documenting a project   team's process and results. This documentation will help the team avoid making   similar mistakes in the future. Furthermore, it will enable those in the   broader conservation community to benefit from the team's experiences. </LI></UL><P>To practice adaptive management, a conservation project team has to go through the steps in the project cycle as outlined in the information about the <i>CMP Open Standards</i>.&nbsp; To learn more about adaptive management, you can consult the sources listed below.</P><p><HR><H3>For More Information About Adaptive Management</H3><P>Argyris, C. and D.

This creates a tacky surface that does not dry out and allows any paper item to stick to it and yet be readily repositioned. Always remember to fold the sticky tarp onto itself (i.e., sticky surface to sticky surface) and to open it carefully not to dislodge the glue from the tarp.

It should also provide the basis for determining where you can intervene with your strategies and where you need to develop indicators to monitor the effectiveness of these strategies.<br><P>It is important to note that a diagram is not so much a step in the adaptive management process, as a tool that your team can use to go through a number of the steps including in particular:</P><BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style=\"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px\">  <P>1B.

Diagrams are also powerful tools for workshops with partners and local stakeholders. On the other hand,&nbsp;diagrams have the disadvantage of often becoming too complex and becoming unmanageable (to avoid this, one rule of thumb is to have no more than 25 boxes or so on any one page). Also, while&nbsp;diagrams are readily understood by many people, a small but non-trivial fraction of people in the world have a strong dislike of this visual way of thinking.</P><br><HR><H3>Conceptual Models</H3>General information about diagrams as a tool for conceptual models can be found in:<br><BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style=\"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px\">  <P>Margoluis, R., and N.

The danger with this approach is that different people might use different criteria or apply them differently. Moreover, there is a tendency to address threats for which strategies and expertise already exist, rather than addressing those that are posing the greatest threat to the biodiversity at a site.<br><P>Threat ranking is a method for making this implicit step more explicit and more objective.

There are many ways to export your information from Miradi to other applications.<br><h4>Export Images</h4>Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export/JPEG Image&gt;</code> or <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export/PNG Image&gt;</code> menu commands  to capture a specific diagram or table on your screen in an image file. This method is particularly useful to:<ul><li>Put a diagram or table in a document or presentation</li><li>Create an image that can be put in a website</li></ul><h4>Export Miradi Zip File</h4>Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export/Miradi Project Zipfile&gt;</code> menu command to capture your entire project in a small zip file. This method is particularly useful to:<ul><li>Send your project to another Miradi user</li><li>Create a backup copy of your project</li></ul><h4>Export Project XML File</h4>Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export/Project XML File&gt;</code> menu command to create an XML file with all your project data. Although managing the XML file will require technical skills, this method is particularly useful to:<ul><li>Create a file that can be imported by a database</li><li>Export all of your project's information into formats that can be read by other applications</li></ul><h4>Export Tab Delimited Data</h4>Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export/Tab Delimited Data&gt;</code> menu command to export the currently viewed table to a tab-delimited file. This method is particularly useful to:<ul><li>Export the current configuration from your planning view to a spreadsheet like Excel</li><li>Export financial information</li></ul><h4>Generate Reports</h4>Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Reports&gt;</code> view to create a PDF (Adobe Acrobat) or ODT (Open Office) file that contains various configurations of your project data. This method is particularly useful to:<ul><li>Create a document that can be edited in the Open Office Word Processor</li><li>Create a standard report for a donor or other key audience for your project</li></ul>"

The two most useful formats are as either a PDF file that can be read by Adobe Acrobat or an ODT file that can be read by the Open Office program (this is an open-source office suite available for free at <a href='http://www.openoffice.org'>www.openoffice.org</a>). Once you have created these files, you can then further edit the report using either Acrobat or the Open Office word processor.</p><p class='hint'><b>Hint:</b> Although the Miradi 2.0 report view also offers the choice of saving a document in a RTF format that can be read by MS Word and other word processors, we do not recommend using this format at this time.  Among other things, it places all table cells in individual text boxes, making it extremely difficult to edit text. A better solution is to export to Open Office and then use Open Office to save a document that can be read by MS Word. We hope to have better direct suppport for the RTF format in future releases of Miradi.</p><p class='hint'><b>Hint:</b> If you make changes in Acrobat or a word processor, they will not be maintained the next time you generate a report. As a result, try to make the changes in the appropriate Miradi fields where possible.</p>"

Often, project teams get stuck trying to come up with perfect benchmarks of target health, especially when the scientific information needed to establish these benchmarks is often lacking or inadequate. In these cases, project teams should rely on general ecological concepts, comparisons to other similar systems, well-informed expert opinion, or failing that, the team members' best estimate to determine a \"credible first iteration\" of the benchmarks and assessment of the current rating.<br><P>For the initial planning, it is often sufficient to describe the benchmarks for Good and Fair, since this distinction is the most important for determining the need for management actions. As shown in the following example, if you treat this as the first step in an iterative process, you can almost always put some initial thinking down. Identifying gaps and weaknesses in existing knowledge is also crucial to help you spur investigations to improve the state of knowledge about your focal targets.</P><P>For example, suppose a project team is working on a project with a grassland target. They decide that one of the key ecological attributes is fire regime and the indicator of the fire regime is fire frequency. They know that the grassland that they are responsible for managing is full of woody species and the grasses and forbs are not flowering well and they haven't seen some grassland nesting bird species in a few years. As a result, they are pretty certain that the grassland needs to burn, but they don't know how frequently the grassland would burn in a natural state. So in their first pass, the team fills out the viability rating scale as follows:</P><P><IMG src=\"images/TargetViability/viability_example_1.png\"  width='557' height='232'border=0></P><P>This team has defined Fair as being \"fire not frequent enough\" and Good as being \"fire frequent enough.\" This is perfectly acceptable for their first attempt. Later, the team locates a local grassland expert. She tells them that fire should occur every 5-10 years to maintain the structure of this type of grassland. This additional information enables them to fill out the table as:</P><P><IMG src=\"images/TargetViability/viability_example_2.png\"  width='555' height='232'border=0></P><P>Reviewing the literature and consulting with experts, the team comes to realize, however, that it is not just the presence of fire anywhere on the site that matters, but that a sufficient portion of the site should burn on a regular interval. To this end, over a few years, the team does some more research about the frequency of fires and they redefine their indicator and ratings as follows:</P><P><IMG src=\"images/TargetViability/viability_example_3.png\"  width='557' height='232'border=0></P><P>Any of the above outcomes is acceptable for a first iteration of your viability analysis depending on the level of information available.</P></BODY></HTML>"

In particular, you need to be able to define specific future goals, assess the current status of the system today, and measure your progress as you move towards these goals. For example, medical doctors define healthy individuals as having, among other things, a pulse rate and blood pressure within an appropriate range for their age and condition. If a patient is outside of the normal range, then the doctor can prescribe therapy and then monitor the patient's condition over time as they hopefully move towards a desired goal in the normal range.<br><P>This process of setting measurable goals is particularly challenging for the focal conservation targets used by biodiversity projects. Most focal conservation targets are themselves very complex systems that vary naturally over time. It is thus not easy to define or measure the \"health\" of a bear or migratory fish population, a forest, or a coral reef in a systematic and repeatable fashion. Target Viability Analysis is a flexible and yet powerful methodology that has been developed to help solve this problem, based on sound ecological principles. It provides a consistent framework for defining the current status, and desired future condition of focal conservation targets. </P><P>Viability analysis has primarily been developed by The Nature Conservancy.&nbsp;The Conservancy has published a number of different guides to doing viability analysis.

msgid "html|/resources/wizard/SummaryView/SummaryWizardDefineTeamMembersRight.html|<div class='navigation'>Conservation does not happen on its own. The most important resources for any conservation project are the people who will be involved in designing and implementing it. Their commitment and skills will influence how effective the project can be. Your project team's membership will likely change over time. It is often helpful to think about: <ul><li><strong>Initial Project Team -</strong> The people who conceive of and initiate the project.</li><br><li><strong>Core Project Team -</strong> A small group of people (typically 3-8 people) who are ultimately responsible for designing and managing a project.</li><br><li><strong>Full Project Team -</strong> The complete group of people involved in designing, implementing, monitoring, and learning from a project. This group can include managers, stakeholders, researchers, and other key implementers.  You need a wide range of skills on your project team. Project team members should include representatives from the primary organization implementing the project, but ideally will include other partners as well.</li></ul><p>Within your project team, there are also a number of different roles to consider. Some of the most common roles include:</p><ul><li><strong>Project Leader/Manager -</strong> Although leadership responsibilities are often shared between team members, normally one individual is appointed as the overall project leader. Specific roles that the leader often plays include managing the performance of other team members, relations with key stakeholders, and the process of going through the project cycle.</li><br><li><strong>Process Facilitator -</strong> A process facilitator is a person who can help the project team through the planning process. A process facilitator is typically part of the initial and/or the core team. A good facilitator understands the key elements of the process, has good facilitation skills, and can keep your team from getting too bogged down in any one part of the process. This person does not need to be a &quot;professional&quot; facilitator, but should be someone who is intimately familiar with applying the planning process to &quot;real-world&quot; conservation problems.</li><br><li><strong>Primary Contact -</strong> The person(s) that people outside the project team should contact to learn more about the project.</li></ul>These roles can be assigned to one person, or to different people as needed. Two other groups of people to consider are:<ul><li><strong>Project Advisors -</strong> People who are not on the project team, but to whom the team members can turn for honest feedback and counsel and who can champion your cause.</li><br><li><strong>Project Stakeholders -</strong>  Individuals, groups, or institutions who have a vested interest in the natural resources of the project area and/or who potentially will be affected by project activities and have something to gain or lose if conditions change or stay the same. Just because someone is a stakeholder does not mean that you will want them on your project team.

As described in the right hand panel, reports are only one of many ways to export your information from Miradi to other applications.<p>Miradi currently supports two types of reports:<ul><li><b>Standard Reports - </b>These are pre-defined reports that produce documents in accordance with the CMP Open Standards. Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Full&nbsp;Project&nbsp;Report&gt;</code> button to create a document showing all of your project info; use the remaining buttons to create a document showing one section of your plan.</li><br><li><b>Custom Reports - </b>These are pre-defined reports that produce documents in accordance with the needs of a specific organization. Use the appropriate button to generate the report that you want. Contact us at <A href=\"mailto:support@miradi.org\">support@miradi.org</A> if you would like to develop your own custom report.</li></ul><p>Once you select one of the reports, Miradi will generate a window with the basic report information. Use the toolbar buttons to jump from page to page and to adjust the view. Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Save&gt;</code> button and then the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Files&nbsp;of&nbsp;Type&gt;</code> drop down list at the bottom of the dialogue box to generate a report in various formats. The two most useful formats are as either a PDF file that can be read by Adobe Acrobat or an ODT file that can be read by the Open Office program (this is an open-source office suite available for free at <a href='http://www.openoffice.org'>www.openoffice.org</a>). Once you have created these files, you can then further edit the report using either Acrobat or the Open Office word processor.</p><p class='hint'><b>Hint:</b> Although the Miradi 2.0 report view also offers the choice of saving a document in a RTF format that can be read by MS Word and other word processors, we do not recommend using this format at this time.  Among other things, it places all table cells in individual text boxes, making it extremely difficult to edit text. A better solution is to export to Open Office and then use Open Office to save a document that can be read by MS Word. We hope to have better direct suppport for the RTF format in future releases of Miradi.</p><p class='hint'><b>Hint:</b> If you make changes in Acrobat or a word processor, they will not be maintained the next time you generate a report.

To this end, it is important to develop <i>indicators</i> that can be used to assess the attribute over time. An indicator, in simplest terms, is what you measure to keep track of the status of a key ecological attribute.<P>In many cases an indicator can be the same as the attribute itself. For example, if your attribute is population size, the indicator may be the number of individuals in the population if you can count this number directly. If you cannot count this number directly, then your indicator will specify how you will measure this number - for example, for a fish population, as catch per unit effort using a specific technique at a given time of the year.</P><p>In other cases, however, developing a good indicator will require a bit more thinking to find a way of measuring the attribute over time. For example, if your attribute is the water quality of a stream, it is not possible to measure every physical and chemical parameter. Instead, you would select a few representative parameters - for example water temperature and oxygen levels - that you feel can represent the overall water quality. You can also combine several measurable properties into a composite indicator or index.</P><P>Indicators frequently involve some type of quantitative assessment - such as number of acres, recruitment rate, age class sizes, percent of cover, or frequency of fire of a given intensity. Other indicators may involve measurable elements that are not numeric, such as the seasonality of fire or flooding.</P>"

But by themselves, they are not sufficient to determine the health of a given target. Instead, they need to be placed in an appropriate context or frame of reference. Just as a healthy person's pulse rate or blood pressure changes over the course of a day and over a lifetime, most key ecological attributes will vary over time. For example, the size of migratory fish population might go up and down on a year-to-year basis.</p><p>As shown in the figure below, however, there is a difference between a population size that is within the <i>acceptable range of variation</i> (ARV) and one that is outside this acceptable range. For some attributes, this acceptable range is one-sided (for example, it may be possible to have too little, but not too much of a particular kind of forest within a project area). For other attributes, the acceptable range is two-sided (for example, there can be too many or too few deer per hectare in the forest). In some cases, we may be able to precisely determine critical thresholds that clearly mark the boundary of this acceptable range, whereas in other cases we can only approximate where these thresholds might be. These thresholds, however, establish what you determine as the acceptable range of variation for your target.<P><IMG height=295 alt=\"\" hspace=10 src=\"images/TargetViability/5b_criticalthresh.png\" width=402 align=right vspace=10 border=0></P><P>Once you have estimated the acceptable range of variation for an attribute, you can then go on to specify the viability rating scale. This scale involves establishing the following boundaries for an indicator based on your thresholds:</P>				<UL><LI><STRONG>Very Good</STRONG> - Ecologically desirable status; requires little intervention for maintenance. <LI><STRONG>Good</STRONG> - Indicator within acceptable range of variation; some intervention required for maintenance. 				  <LI><STRONG>Fair</STRONG> - Outside acceptable range of variation; requires human intervention. <LI><STRONG>Poor</STRONG> - Restoration increasingly difficult; may result in extirpation of target. 	</LI></UL><P>In effect, by establishing this rating scale, you are specifying your assumption as to what constitutes a \"conserved\" target versus one that is in need of management intervention. This rating scale is directly analogous with the established pulse rate and blood pressure ranges that a doctor uses to determine whether a patient's circulatory system - and thus by extension the entire patient - is healthy. Although ideally you would define all four boxes of the rating scale, in many projects, you may find that you can only define one or two key boxes - for example the threshold between Fair and Good - especially in 		early stages of your work.</P> </div>"

msgid "html|/resources/WWFAbout.html|  <h3>About WWF</h3>WWF was formed in 1961. It was the product of a deep concern held by a few eminent gentlemen who were worried by what they saw happening in our world at that time. Since those early days WWF has grown to be one of the largest conservation organizations in the world.  Currently there are more than 2000 WWF conservation projects underway around the world. The vast majority of these focus on local issues. They range from school nature gardens in Zambia, to initiatives that appear on the packaging in your local supermarket; from the restoration of orangutan habitats to the establishment of giant panda reserves. <p>In this new millennium WWF continues to improve its work as it focuses on issues that are relevant to people around the world. Our initiatives aim to conserve some of the most important natural places on Earth. In complement to our placed-based work, WWF also focuses efforts on a set of ecologically, economically and culturally important species. WWF believes that targeting efforts to reduce humanity's footprint on our planet so that there are enough natural resources, space and air for people and other forms of life is also of prime concern. In all of our efforts, we try to understand the drivers of change so that our actions are well planned and executed.</p><p>All of our work involves partnerships of one sort or another. We team up with local non-profit agencies and other global NGOs. We form relationships with village elders, local councils and regional and national government offices. And in this day and age of globalization, critically, we work with businesses who are willing to change themselves and facilitate change in their sector.</p><p><b>WWF's Mission:</b><br>To stop the degradation of the planet's natural environment and to build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature, by:<li>conserving the world's biological diversity</li><li>ensuring that the use of renewable natural resources is sustainable</li><li>promoting the reduction of pollution and wasteful consumption.</li>"

msgid "html|/resources/RAREAbout.html|  <h3>About Rare</h3>Rare, a U.S.-based conservation organization, works globally to equip people in the world's most threatened natural areas with the tools and motivation they need to care for their natural resources. For the last 30 years, at more than 90 sites, and in more than 40 nations, Rare has focused as much on people as on science - addressing the underlying social and economic factors that create environmental threats. <p>Rare's approach has been to develop a suite of social marketing and business development tools that motivate local communities to protect their natural surroundings. Rare's signature Pride campaign builds grassroots support for environmental protection by training local conservation leaders in the use of commercial marketing tactics to build awareness, influence attitudes, and enable meaningful change. Pride campaigns produce a groundswell of support that leads to tangible conservation successes, such as new national parks, reform legislation, or reduction of threats from forest fires or over-fishing.</p>"

msgid "html|/resources/ThreatRatingBundleRules.html|  <html>  <head>      </head>  <body>    <div>      <h3>Explanation of How Threat Rating Summaries Are Calculated</h3>      Miradi uses a combination of rules for rolling up ratings across targets and threats, and for the project as a whole.<p>As shown in the grid below, the bottom row contains the overall ratings for each target, and the far right-hand column contains the ratings for each threat. Finally, the cell in the lower right-hand corner contains the overall rating for the project. Normally the overall project rating is based on rolling up the threat ratings in the right-most column, using the 3-5-7 and 2-Prime rules.</p><h4>3-5-7 Rule</h4>Multiple threats to individual targets and multiple target threat scores are first summed together using the 3-5-7 rule:      <ul><li>3 High rated threats are equivalent to 1 Very High-rated threat;</li><li>5 Medium rated threats are equivalent to 1 High-rated threat;</li><li>7 Low rated threats are equivalent to 1 Medium-rated threat</li></ul><p>In the example below, the second row shows the Housing threat. There are 3 High ratings (which equals 1 Very High) and 1 Very High rating, so it is treated as if it had two Very High ratings. In the Lone Chapparal Column, there are 5 Medium ratings (which equals one High), plus one High, for a total equivalent of 2 High ratings.</p> <h4>2-Prime Rule</h4>After the 3-5-7 rule has been applied, the 2-prime rule is used to determine the rolled up rating for a target, a threat, or for the whole project. This rule requires the equivalent of two ratings at a certain level for the end result to be that level. For example, there would have to be the equivalent of at least two Very High ratings to produce a Very High result, or two ratings of Medium or above to produce a Medium result.      <p>In the example below, the Housing threat row has the equivalent of two Very High ratings (due to the 3-5-7 rule), so the result is Very High. The Recreational Vehicles row has one Medium rating and one Low. Since it does not have two or more Mediums, the result is Low.</p><h4>Majority Override</h4>      The Majority Override rule ensures that the overall project rating is not reduced too much by the other rules. Normally, the overall project rating is a rollup of the threat ratings, using the rules above. However, if a majority of the targets have a rating higher than that computed rollup, then that majority rating is used instead.</p><p>For example, if the result of using the 3-5-7 and 2-prime rules gave a project rating of Medium, but 4 out of the 6 targets had at least one rating of at High (or Very High), then the Majority Override rule would take effect and the overall project rating would be High.</p><br>      <img width=\"834\" height=\"350\" src=\"images/BundleSummaries.png\">    </div>  </body></html>"
