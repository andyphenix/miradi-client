<p>At this point, you should have already developed your basic work plan showing <a href='Definition:Activity' class='definition'>activities</a>/<a href='Definition:Method'  class='definition'>methods</a> and <a href='Definition:Task' class='definition'>tasks</a> and assigning <a href='Definition:Resource' class='definition'>resources</a> to each.</p>

<p>To add budget detail to an activity/method or task, click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Work Plan&gt;</code> radio button in the Planning View and select the item that you want to focus on.  You should already see the number of units for each quarter for that resource. Using the drop down menu, you can then assign an <a href='Definition:AccountingCodes' class='definition'>accounting code</a> and <a href='Definition:FundingSources' class='definition'>funding source</a> for that resource.</p>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong>  The same resource may have different accounting codes or funding sources for different activities/ methods or tasks.</p>

<p>If you have already added the cost per unit for a resource, at this point you should see the total cost for that resource for the quarter and rolled up for the year.  The annual 	amount is then displayed in the table at the top of the page.  Click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Resources&gt;</code> tab and select the resource in the table if you need to edit the cost per unit information.</p>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong>  The current version of Miradi only supports financial expenses that can be assigned to a specific resource.</p>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong>  If you need to adjust the planning horizon for your project, go to the project start and end date fields in the Summary View.</p>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong>  You can edit the number decimal places for currency amounts in the Summary View.</p><br></br>
