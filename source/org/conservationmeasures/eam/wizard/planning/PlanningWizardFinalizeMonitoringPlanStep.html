Click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Monitoring Plan&gt;</code> radio button in the Planning View 
to view and edit this plan. You can look at your plans 
either based on your overall conceptual model, or on specific 
results chains by collapsing and expanding elements of the tree.

Note that in your monitoring plan, a given strategy may be 
repeated several times if it contributes to more than one goal or 
objective. In your work plan, by contrast, strategies are not repeated.
