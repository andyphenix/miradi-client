Just as each 
<a href='Definition:Strategy' class='definition'>strategy</a>  
will have on or more 
<a href='Definition:Activity' class='definition'>activities</a>  
 associated with it, each monitoring 
<a href='Definition:Indicator' class='definition'>indicator</a>  
will also have one or more 
<a href='Definition:Method' class='definition'>methods</a>  
 associated with it.  
</p>
<p>
In the Planning View, click on the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Work Plan&gt;</code> 
 radio button and select an indicator that you want to focus on.  
Think about the specific methods that you will have to 
undertake to measure this indicator.  Click on the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Create Method&gt;</code>
 button to add a new method and then type the name 
of the method in the label box in the bottom panel.  
If necessary, you can have multiple methods for each indicator.  
Repeat for other indicators as needed.  You can use the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Move Item Up&gt;</code>
and the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Move Item Down&gt;</code>
buttons to change the order.
</p>
<p>
If necessary, you can also highlight a method and click on the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Create Task&gt;</code>
button to add tasks under this method.  (If you are really detail 
oriented, you can even create sub-tasks under 
<a href='Definition:Task' class='definition'>tasks</a>.)
