Each 
<a href='Definition:Strategy' class='definition'>strategy</a> 
will have one or more 
<a href='Definition:Activity' class='definition'>activities</a> 
associated with it. </p> <p>In the Planning View, click on the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Work Plan&gt;</code> 
radio button and select a strategy that you want to focus on in the tree.  Think about 
the specific activities that you will have to undertake to carry 
out this strategy.  Click on the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Create Activity&gt;</code> 
 button to 
add a new activity and then type the name of the activity in 
the item field in the bottom panel.  Repeat for other activities 
for this strategy as needed.  You can use the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Move Item Up&gt;</code> 
and the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Move Item Down&gt;</code> 
buttons to change the order.
</p>
<p>
If necessary, you can also highlight an activity and click on the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Create Task&gt;</code>
button to add 
<a href='Definition:Task' class='definition'>tasks</a> 
 under this activity.  (If you are really detail 
oriented, you can even create sub-tasks under tasks.)
