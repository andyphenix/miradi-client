          	<p>
          		<strong>Accounting</strong> codes are a set of categories developed by 
          		an organization to categorize and track expenses.  
          		They typically include hierarchical strings of numbers 
          		and/or letters (the code) along with a text description.  For example:
          	</p>
          
          
			<p>
				<strong>200.000 Core Salaries</strong><br></br>
				201.000  Director's salaries<br></br>
				202.000  Staff salaries<br></br>

			</p>          
			
			<p>
				Information that is tracked through the use of accounting codes can include:
			</p>          
			
			<ul>
			  <li>
			  	<p><strong>Expense Type -</strong> Salary, travel, equipment, etc.  This information is often used to help prepare reports to donors and/or tax returns.</p>
			  </li>          
			  <li>
			    <p><strong>Department -</strong> The branch of the organization that is incurring the expense.</p>
			  </li>          
			  <li>
			    <strong>Funding Source -</strong> Some organizations also use their codes to specify the specific funding source (although Miradi also treats this separately).</p>
			  </li>          
			  <li>
			    <p><strong>Other Information -</strong> Categories that the organization wants to track.</p>
			  </li>          
			</ul>
          
          <p>
          	It is likely that your home organization will already have a chart 
          	of accounts that they will want you to use. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
          Funding sources are, as the name implies, the sources of money 
          available to your project.  They are typically divided into:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
			  <li>
			  	<p><strong>Restricted sources -</strong> Funds such as a grant from a donor that are dedicated to a specific project or set of activities</p>
			  </li>          
			  <li>
			    <p><strong>Unrestricted sources -</strong> Funds that can be used in any way the project chooses</p>
			  </li>          
			</ul>
