<p>Click on the Work Plan radio button to <strong>see an overview of your plan.</strong> 
In the tree, clicking on the + and - symbols enables 
you to <strong>expand</strong> or <strong>collapse</strong> different parts of the hierarchy.  
Items in the table can include activities, methods, and tasks 
(note that tasks apply to both activities and methods).  
Click on the buttons below to add, delete, or move 
an item up and down the hierarchy.

<p>
The bottom panel is used to <strong>assign resources</strong> to each item.  
Assignments can be made at the level of an activity/method or its component tasks. 
</p>

<p>
You can <strong>edit the name of activity</strong> or method directly or by clicking on the Activities Only or Methods Only radio buttons. Clicking on a row in the table will allow you to bring up and 
edit the information for that row. Click on the Resources 
tab to <strong>create, edit, or delete a resource.</strong>
