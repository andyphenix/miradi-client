            <p>A <strong>goal</strong> is a formal statement detailing a desired impact of a project.  
            In conservation projects, it is the desired future status of a target. A good goal meets the criteria of being:</p>
          
			<ul>
			  <li>
			  	<p><strong>Linked to Targets:</strong> Directly associated with one or more of your biodiversity targets</p>
			  </li>          
			  <li>
			    <p><strong>Impact Oriented:</strong> Represents the desired future status of the target over the long-term</p>
			  </li>          
			  <li>
			    <strong>Measurable:</strong> Definable in relation to some standard scale (numbers, percentage, fractions, or all/nothing states)</p>
			  </li>          
			  <li>
			    <p><strong>Time Limited:</strong> Achievable within a specific period of time, often 10 or more years</p>
			  </li>          
			  <li>
			    <p><strong>Specific:</strong>Clearly defined so that all people involved in the project have the same understanding of what the terms in the goal mean</p>
			  </li>          
			</ul>
