 <p> Miradi currently supports planning and budgeting in 3-month <a href='Definition:Quarter' class='definition'>quarters</a>; it will eventually support other time frames. As a general rule, you should have a detailed work plan for the coming 2 to 4 quarters and a rough plan for the years after that.
