<p><h2>Explanation of How Overall Threat Ratings Are Calculated</h2></p>
<p></p>
The left-hand matrix shows the rule-based procedure for combining the rankings 
<br></br>
for the Scope and Severity variables to get a ranking of 
<a href='none'><em>Threat Magnitude</em></a>.  
<br></br>
Under these rules, if a threat is rated 'low' on either variable, 
then the magnitude is 'low' overall. 
<br></br>
Threat magnitude is then combined with Irreversibility ratings 
using the right-hand matrix 
<br></br>
to get the 
<a href='none'><em>Overall Threat Rating</em></a>.
