<p class='hintheading'><strong>Navigation Hints for the Summary View
and the Overall Application</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>Summary View</strong>
</p>
The first few &quot;Summary View&quot; tabs contain basic information fields that most projects will want to fill in about their project, team, scope, location, and planning. This basic information will be especially important when you export your project to various reports and databases. Some organizations also have their own custom data fields for their projects. You can find these by clicking on the appropriate tab. 
<p>
<strong>Overall Application</strong>
</p>
All views have an interview pane on top and an action pane below. Use the previous and next buttons to <strong>move backwards and forward</strong> through the interview.  
<strong>You can resize or hide the interview pane</strong> 
by using the splitter and/or arrows.  In many dialog boxes, you can use the <strong> directions button </strong> at the bottom left to <strong> go the appropriate interview page.</strong>   
Use the buttons on the upper right to get context sensitive 
<strong>additional information, examples</strong>, and 
<strong>workshop hints</strong>.
<p></p>
Note that the program automatically saves all changes so there is no 
&quot;save&quot; command.  You can save a copy under a different name using the &quot;Copy Project To&quot; command.
