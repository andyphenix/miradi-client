<p>
A project's 
<a href='Definition:Scope' class='definition'>scope</a>
is the broad focus of the project. Projects focused 
on the biodiversity of a specific place have a geographic scope (project area), 
such as a national park or tribal fishing grounds. In some cases, you 
may need to define your biodiversity targets before coming to a final decision 
about the geographic boundaries of your project. If you are working in a watershed, 
for example, you may be interested in conserving a forested area that stretches from 
your watershed into a neighboring basin. In this case, the definition of your targets 
would cause you to extend the geographic boundaries of your project scope. 
</p>
<p>
Other projects have a thematic scope, with a focus on a population of wide ranging 
animals, such as migratory birds, mammals or sea turtles, or a focus on certain ecological 
systems, such as forests, or issues such as illegal trade of rare and endangered species 
or poverty. 
</p>
<p>
If there is any doubt about the basic scope of your project, then discuss the options 
with the members of your project team and see if you have at least a general consensus. 
If you can't arrive at some basic consensus, then you need to seriously reconsider 
whether you should split into multiple projects.
