<strong>Roles</strong> - 
The roles that the person plays on the team.</li><li>
<strong>Organization / Position / Phone / Email</strong> - Information about the team member.</li><li>
<strong>Unit(s) / Cost Per Unit</strong> -

Click the
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Close&gt;</code> 
button when you are finished.  Add other team members as necessary.
</p><p>Note that team members often include people from other organizations. In some cases, team members/human resources are not just one person, but rather a sub-team or class of indivdiuals - for example, a biological monitoring team.
