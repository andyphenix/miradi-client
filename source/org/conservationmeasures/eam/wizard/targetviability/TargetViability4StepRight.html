				            <P>Although key ecological attributes are specific descriptions of an aspect of 
				a target, they are generally still too broad to measure or assess in a 
				cost-effective manner over time. To this end, it is important to develop 
				<STRONG>indicators</STRONG> that can be used to assess the attribute over time. 
				An indicator, in simplest terms, is what you measure to keep track of the status 
				of a key ecological attribute.</P>
				<P>In many cases an indicator can be the same as the attribute itself. For 
				example, if your attribute is population size, the indicator may be the number 
				of individuals in the population if you can count this number directly. If you 
				cannot count this number directly, then your indicator will specify how you will 
				measure this number – for example, for a fish population, as catch per unit 
				effort using a specific technique at a given time of the year. 
				</P>
				<p>In other cases, 
				however, developing a good indicator will require a bit more thinking to find a 
				way of measuring the attribute over time. For example, if your attribute is the 
				water quality of a stream, it is not possible to measure every physical and 
				chemical parameter. Instead, you would select a few representative parameters – 
				for example water temperature and oxygen levels – that you feel can represent 
				the overall water quality. You can also combine several measurable properties 
				into a composite indicator or index.</P>
				<P>Indicators frequently involve some type of quantitative assessment – such as 
				number of acres, recruitment rate, age class sizes, percent of cover, or 
				frequency of fire of a given intensity. Other indicators may involve measurable 
				elements that are not numerical, such as the seasonality of fire or flooding. 
				</P>
				<P>Indicators can be assigned different priorities as follows:</P>
				<UL>
				  <LI><STRONG>Very High:</STRONG> Must be monitored 
				  <LI><STRONG>High:</STRONG> High priority for monitoring 
				  <LI><STRONG>Medium:</STRONG> Moderate priority for monitoring 
				  <LI><STRONG>Low:</STRONG> Monitor only if resources allow</LI></UL>
				<P>You can record the current&nbsp;progress in monitoring each indicator as 
				follows:</P>
				<UL>
				  <LI><STRONG>Fully on Schedule: </STRONG>Monitoring going as planned or better 
				  <LI><STRONG>Going Well:</STRONG> Monitoring generally progressing 
				  <LI><STRONG>Problems Implementing:</STRONG> Monitoring encountering some 
				  challenges 
				  <LI><STRONG>Not Started:</STRONG> Little or no work done to 
				date</LI></UL>
