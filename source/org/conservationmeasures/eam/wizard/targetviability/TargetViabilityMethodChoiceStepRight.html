          	<P><STRONG>Two Methods for Viability Analysis</STRONG></P>
			<P>Miradi currently supports two methods for viability analysis.</P>
			<UL>
			  <LI><STRONG>Basic Viability Analysis</STRONG> - This method asks 
			  you to think about each target and to identify specific <STRONG>goals</STRONG> 
			  that outline the desired future condition of the target for your 
			  project.&nbsp;It then asks you to develop specific <STRONG>indicators</STRONG> 
			  that might be used to measure each goal.&nbsp;This method is relatively simple 
			  and very flexible, but&nbsp;does&nbsp;not readily lend itself 
			  to&nbsp;systematic assesment of target viability.&nbsp;<BR>
			  
			  <LI><STRONG>Detailed Viability Analysis</STRONG> - This method 
			  asks you develop specific <STRONG>key ecological attributes 
			  (KEAs)</STRONG>&nbsp;for each target and specific <STRONG>indicators</STRONG> 
			  for each KEA.&nbsp;It then has you&nbsp;determine - to the best of your 
			  ability - an <STRONG>acceptable range of variation</STRONG> for each 
			  indicator, or in other words, to determine what a healthy target would look 
			  like.&nbsp;Finally, the method requires that you specify both the 
			  <STRONG>current status</STRONG> of each indicator as well as the 
			  <STRONG>desired&nbsp;future status</STRONG>. Collectively, the desired future status for all attributes become the			  <STRONG>goal</STRONG> for this target.&nbsp;This method is more systematic and enables 
			  comparisons across projects, but is more complex to design and 
			  implement.
			 </LI>
			</UL>
			<P>It is important to note that both methods have the same ultimate 
			outputs - the&nbsp;goal for each target and the&nbsp;indicator that will be used 
			to assess progress towards this goal.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
