				<P>The <a href='Definition:Measurement' class='definition'>measurement</a> rating describes the indicator rating 
				category where your key ecological attribute is today.</P>
				<P>The four-category framework for categorizing the viability status for each 
				KEA and target provides little opportunity to describe and keep track of 
				incremental changes.&nbsp;The data fields for both current 
				and future status allow you to record information on incremental change in 
				indicators. </P>
				<P>There is a big difference between an indicator that 
				currently&nbsp;has good status, but is rapidly decreasing, versus one that has 
				good status, but is staying constant or increasing.&nbsp;It is thus often useful 
				to display the&nbsp;<STRONG>trend</STRONG>&nbsp;in the indicator.&nbsp;It is 
				also important to specify your <STRONG>confidence</STRONG> in the 
				indicator.&nbsp;The confidence ratings are defined as follows:</P>
				<UL>
				  <LI><STRONG>Rough Guess</STRONG> - Values are rough estimates by project team 
				  members. They are often an initial placeholder value meant to be improved down 
				  the road through use of other methods.</LI>
				  <LI><STRONG>Expert Knowledge</STRONG> - Values are more refined estimates 
				  provided by experienced, reliable observers who know the local project 
				  conditions, but are not basing their estimates on any specific data or 
				  observations. These experts may be project team members, professionals 
				  managers, researchers, or members of a traditional community that have reason 
				  to take note of the conditions of interest and the experience necessary to 
				  provide reliable information. This category also includes educated guesses 
				  made by extrapolating data from other similar sites.</LI>
				  <LI><STRONG>Rapid Assessment</STRONG> - Values are derived from data collected 
				  about this specific project area using relatively simple methods, including 
				  visual and auditory assessment. Data collection methods use protocols, field 
				  records and quality control procedures of varying degrees of standardization. 
				  They typically provide either presence/absence, categorial, or other other 
				  qualitative measurements of indicator values, or rough quantitative 
				  measurements.</LI>
				  <LI><STRONG>Intensive Assessment</STRONG> - Values are derived from data 
				  collected about this specific project area using relatively detailed, 
				  quantitative methods. Data collection methods use standard protocols, field 
				  records and quality control procedures. They typically provide quantitative 
				  measurements of indicator values as well as an estimate of error. </LI></UL>
				<P>Note that both rapid and intensive assessments can include data collected by 
				non-project staff, or even public data available on the internet -- the key is 
				that the data have to be about the project's specific site, targets, threats, 
				and other factors, rather than extrapolating from other 
				systems.</P>
