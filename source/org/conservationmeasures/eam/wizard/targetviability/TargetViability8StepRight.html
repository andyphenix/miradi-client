				<P>The current status rating describes the indicator rating category where your 
				key ecological attribute is today; the <a href='Definition:DesiredFutureStatus' class='definition'>desired future status</a> rating 
				describes where you want to be in the future.&nbsp;The desired&nbsp;future 
				status is a <a href='Definition:Goal' class='definition'>goal</a> (or at least a sub-goal) for your project.&nbsp;You should consider the appropriate spatial extent and time frame for achieving the desired status; some changes may require long time periods (50-100 years). 
				</P>
				
<P>A goal technically has more than just the indicator value - it&nbsp;is a formal statement detailing a desired impact of a project.&nbsp; A good goal meets the criteria of being: </P>
				<UL>
				  <LI><STRONG>Linked to Targets:</STRONG> Directly associated with one or more 
				  of your biodiversity targets 
				  <LI><STRONG>Impact Oriented:</STRONG> Represents the desired future status of 
				  the target over the long-term 
				  <LI><STRONG>Measurable:</STRONG> Definable in relation to some standard scale 
				  (numbers, percentage, fractions, or all/nothing states) 
				  <LI><STRONG>Time Limited:</STRONG> Achievable within a specific period of 
				  time, often 10 or more years 
				  <LI><STRONG>Specific: </STRONG>Clearly defined so that all people involved in 
				  the project have the same understanding of what the terms in the goal mean 
				  </LI></UL>  <p>If you are using the Simple viability assessment method, then it is necessary to craft a goal for each target.  If you are using the the Key Attribute viability assessment method, however, then technically all of your Future Status measurements for that target together represent the goal. Some projects in this situation may choose to develop an overarching goal for each target that summarizes the various desired future status measurements for all of that target's KEAs.</div>
