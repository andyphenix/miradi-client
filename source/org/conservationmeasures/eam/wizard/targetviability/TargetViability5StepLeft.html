			<P>For a selected indicator, select the "good" box in the indicator ratings table 
			and type in the good box what you think the minimum 
			<U>acceptable range of variation</U> might be for that 
			indicator.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can then also specify what might be in the "fair" 
			box.&nbsp;For example, a project team might say that&nbsp;an indicator for a 
			grassland target is the presence of regular fire events.&nbsp;They might lay out 
			an initial estimate as follows:</P>

			<STRONG>Hint:</STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing 
			indicator ratings is an adaptive process.&nbsp;You should not expect to 
			immediately&nbsp;specify highly quantitative and precise 
			thresholds.&nbsp;Instead, in your first pass through the table, you may only 
			have qualitative assessments.&nbsp;
