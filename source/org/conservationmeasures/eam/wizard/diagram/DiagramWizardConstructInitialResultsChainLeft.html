				<P>Developing a results chain starts by 
				taking the factors from the conceptual model.  Both targets (green 
				ovals) and strategies (yellow hexagons) look the same.  But the 
				other factors have shifted as shown in the following diagram.  In addition, 
				the text of the direct threat and contributing factor boxes are now in brackets 
				indicating that the text has not yet been converted from a factor to a 
				result.

					<table>
	              	<tr>
	              	<td align='right'>
	              	<img border='0' src="images/DiagramWizard/cm-and-rc.png" width= '446' height='198'>
	              	</td>
	              	</tr>
	            	</table>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				To convert your factors to results, click 
				on each box and edit the text.  The key here is to transform 
				the factor describing the current state of the world into the 
				desired result.
