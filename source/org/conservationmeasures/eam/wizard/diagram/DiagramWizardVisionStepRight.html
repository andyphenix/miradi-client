A 
<a href='Definition:Vision' class='definition'>vision statement</a>
is a general summary of the desired state 
or ultimate condition of the project area that a project is working to achieve.  
A good vision statement meets the criteria of being:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Relatively General</strong>
- Broadly defined to encompass a broad range of potential project activities
</li>
<li>
<strong>Visionary</strong>
- Inspirational in outlining the desired change in the state of the targets 
toward which the project is working 
</li>
<li>
<strong>Brief</strong> 
- Simple and succinct so that all project participants can remember it
</li>
</ul>
