To insert 
<a href='Definition:IndirectThreat' class='definition'>contributing factors</a> 
and 
<a href='Definition:IndirectThreat' class='definition'>opportunities</a>, 
select a threat and brainstorm 
what you think is driving that threat. Select the threat and click the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Insert Contributing Factor&gt;</code>
button on the legend.
</p>
<p>
The software will add a new contributing factor and open a dialog box in which 
you can type the name and a comment. Using the mouse or arrow keys, move the 
factor to wherever you want it to be.  In most models, factors further away 
from the target are placed out to the left-hand side of the page.
</p>
<p><strong>Hint:</strong>To select multiple factors, you can click and drag the mouse. You can also select individual factors with the mouse while holding the shift or control keys (holding the control key also allows you to deselect factors).</p>
