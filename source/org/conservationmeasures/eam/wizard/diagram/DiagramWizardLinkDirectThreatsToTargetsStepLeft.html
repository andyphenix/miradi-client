Many threats affect more than one target. To link your threat 
to another target, select the direct threat, hold the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Shift&gt;</code>
key 
and then select the desired target. Then click on the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Add a Link&gt;</code>
button (the arrow). You can also link direct threats to each other using the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Add a Link&gt;</code>
button (the arrow).
</p>
<p><strong>Hint:</strong>The best way to link two factors in Miradi is to select the first one, hold the shift key, select the second one, and then hit the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Add a Link&gt;</code>
button (the arrow) in the legend. This method avoids the need to scroll through a lengthy list of all factors in the system.</p><p>
If desired, you can also show a 
 <a href='Definition:Stress' class='definition'>stress</a> 
between a direct threat and a target. 
On a link connecting a direct threat with a target, 
double-click or right-click and choose Properties, 
and enter the stress name where prompted.
