<!-- Copyright 2005-2008, Foundations of Success, Bethesda, Maryland (on behalf of the Conservation Measures Partnership, "CMP") and Beneficent Technology, Inc. ("Benetech"), Palo Alto, California. --> <p>Many threats affect more than one target. To link your threat to another target, select the direct threat, hold the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Shift&gt;</code>key and then select the desired target. Then click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Add a Link&gt;</code> button (the arrow). You can also link direct threats to each other using the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Add a Link&gt;</code> button (the arrow).</p><p class='hint'><strong>Hint:</strong>The best way to link two factors in Miradi is to select the first one, hold the shift key, select the second one, and then click the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Add a Link&gt;</code> button (the arrow) in the Control Bar. This method avoids the need to scroll through a lengthy list of all factors in the system.</p><p class='hint'><strong>Hint:</strong>If you end up with spaghetti - many crossing links - you can uncheck "target links" on the Control Bar to hide these links except when you click on a factor.</p><p class='hint'>
<strong>Hint:</strong>If you are using <a href='Definition:Stress' class='definition'>stresses</a>, you can click on the link between the threat and the target to display your stresses in the diagram. Check the <strong>Linked to Threat</strong> field for each stress that you want to appear in that link.</p>




<!--If desired, you can also show a <a href='Definition:Stress' class='definition'>stress</a> between a direct threat and a target. On a link connecting a direct threat with a target, double-click or right-click and choose Properties, and enter the stress name where prompted. </p>-->
