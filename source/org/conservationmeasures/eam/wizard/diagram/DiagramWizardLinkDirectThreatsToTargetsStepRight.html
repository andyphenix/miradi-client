<!--<p>Many conservation projects can adequately capture the complexity of their situation by showing direct threats and targets.  Some projects, however, need to show how a specific direct threat affects a target. A stress is a degraded attribute of a conservation targets that is caused by human activities (e.g., low population size, reduced extent of forest system; reduced river flows; increased sedimentation; lowered groundwater table level). </p>-->
