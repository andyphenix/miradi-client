          	<P>A good results chain should meet the following criteria:
          	</P>
          	
          		<ul>
				    <li><strong>Results Oriented:</strong> Boxes contain desired results (e.g., reduction of hunting), and not activities (e.g., conduct a study).</li>

				    <li><strong>Causally Linked:</strong> There are clear "if...then" connections between successive boxes.</li>
				
				    <li><strong>Demonstrates Change:</strong> Each box describes how you hope the relevant factor will change (e.g., improve, increase, or decrease).</li>
				
				    <li><strong>Reasonably Complete:</strong> There are sufficient boxes to construct logical connections but not so many that the chain becomes overly complex.</li>
				
				    <li><strong>Simple:</strong> There is only one result per box<strong>.</strong></li>
  				</ul>
