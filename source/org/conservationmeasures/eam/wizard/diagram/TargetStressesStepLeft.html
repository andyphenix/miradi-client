<!-- Copyright 2005-2007, Wildlife Conservation Society, Bronx, New York (on behalf of the Conservation Measures Partnership, "CMP") and Beneficent Technology, Inc. ("Benetech"), Palo Alto, California. --> <p>Some conservation planning methodologies, such as The Nature Conservancy's CAP Process, call for identifying the <a href='Definition:Stress' class='definition'>stresses</a> that affect your conservation targets. If you want to use stresses, from the Edit / Preferences menu, select the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Threat Rating View&gt;</code> tab. In this tab, change the <strong>Threat Rating Mode</strong> field to "Stress Based Threat Rating Mode."</p><p>Now, if you double click on a target, you can now click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Stresses&gt;</code> tab in the target properties window. Click on the buttons on the right to create a new stress, clone an existing stress, or create a stress from one of your KEAs. For each stress, you can then fill in the <strong>ID</strong>, <strong>name</strong>, and <strong>details</strong> fields. The <strong>ratings</strong> fields will be used later.</p><p class='hint'>
<strong>Hint:</strong>If you are using stresses, once you have added <a href='Definition:DirectThreat' class='definition'>direct threats</a> to your diagram, you can then click on the link between the threat and the target to display your stresses in the diagram. Check the <strong>Linked to Threat</strong> field for each stress that you want to appear in that link.</p>
