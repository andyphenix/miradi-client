<p>This view enables you to develop a 
<a href='Definition:ConceptualModel' class='definition'>conceptual model</a>
of your project. A good conceptual model
graphically depicts your project's 
<a href='Definition:ConservationTargets' class='definition'>targets</a>, 
<a href='Definition:DirectThreat' class='definition'>direct threats</a>, 
<a href='Definition:IndirectThreat' class='definition'>contributing factors</a>, and 
<a href='Definition:Strategy' class='definition'>strategies</a> - and
more importantly, the relationships between
them.
</p>
<p>
As in any modeling exercise, you should not try
to show all factors and relationships, but only the 
most important ones.
