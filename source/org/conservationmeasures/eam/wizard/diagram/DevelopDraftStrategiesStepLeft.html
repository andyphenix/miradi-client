<p class='taskheading'>Identify Key Factors: Develop Draft Strategies</p>
			<p>
				Once you have isolated the chain that you want to work on, 
				brainstorm draft <a href='Definition:Strategy' class='definition'>strategies</a> that your team could use at 
				various points along the chain.  Select the factor and 
				click the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Insert Draft Strategy&gt;</code> button on the toolbar or legend.

				The software will add a new draft strategy 
				linked to the target and open a dialogue box.  
				Type a name for the strategy and a comment if necessary.
