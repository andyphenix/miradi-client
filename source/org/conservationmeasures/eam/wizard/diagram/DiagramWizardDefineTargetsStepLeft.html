Next, you need to add all of your project's 
<a href='Definition:ConservationTargets' class='definition'> conservation targets</a>
 to your scope.
You should already have one target in your Scope box. You can double click on 
this target and type in the name of your target. You can also add additional 
information about the target in the Comment field.
</p>
<p>
To add additional targets, click on the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Insert a Target&gt;</code>
button and then select 
the target and move it to wherever you want it to be.
