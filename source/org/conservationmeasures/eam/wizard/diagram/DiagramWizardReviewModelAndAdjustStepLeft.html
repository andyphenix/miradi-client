You have constructed your conceptual model in a series of separate steps. 
At this point, you should take a look at your model as a whole and ask 
yourself the following questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Does this model reasonably portray what is happening at my site?
</li>
<li>
Are all the key targets represented?
</li>
<li>
Are all the key direct threats represented?
</li>
<li>
Are all the key indirect threats and opportunities represented?
</li>
<li>
Are the link arrows properly placed?
</li>
<li>
Is anything major missing?
</li>
<li>
Will the model be understandable to my project team?
</li>
<li>
Will the model be understandable to people outside of my project team?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
