          	<p>
          		Draft strategies can be rated on the following criteria:
          	</p>
          	
          		<ul>
			  		<li>
			  			<p><strong>Impact -</strong>  Will the strategy have a high or low level of impact on the situation at your project site?</p>
			  		</li>          
			  		<li>
			    		<p><strong>Duration -</strong> Will the strategy lead to permanent or long-term change or will it only have short-term impact?	</p>
			  		</li>
			  		<li>
			    		<p><strong>Feasibility -</strong> Is the strategy easy or extremely difficult to carry out?</p>
			  		</li>
			  		<li>
			    		<p><strong>Cost -</strong> Is the strategy inexpensive to carry out?  Or is it prohibitively expensive?</p>
			  		</li>                    
				</ul>
          	
          	<p>
          		These ratings are then rolled-up to give an overall summary rating 
          		for the strategy.  Note that if a draft strategy is assigned 
          		any "red" colored rating, then the summary rating will also be "red."
