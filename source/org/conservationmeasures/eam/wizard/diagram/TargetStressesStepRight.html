<div class='navigation'><p>A <a href='Definition:Stress' class='definition'>stress</a> is an impaired aspect of a conservation target that results directly or indirectly from human activities (e.g., low population size, reduced extent of forest system; reduced river flows; increased sedimentation; lowered groundwater table level).</p><p> A stress is a degraded key ecological attribute - one that is outside its acceptable range of variation. Most of the stresses acting on your targets can thus be identified by looking at which key ecological attributes are currently degraded or have a high potential to become degraded within the planning horizon of your project (e.g., the next 10 years).</p></div>
