				Once you have developed your draft strategies, you rate 
				each one in terms of its impact, duration, feasibility, 
				and cost by double clicking on a draft strategy and using 
				the drop-down ratings in the dialog box.  
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Once you have developed all your draft strategies, you 
				can decide which one(s) you want to carry forward.  Unchecking 
				<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;draft&gt;</code> in the status field in the dialogue box will 
				convert the strategy from a light yellow "draft strategy" to 
				a dark yellow "strategy."
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Click the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Show Full Model&gt;</code> button (available on either the 
				toolbar or by right-clicking the mouse) to go back to the 
				full model and hide all your draft strategies.  Note that 
				your draft strategies are still retained 
				in <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Show Selected Factor Chain&gt;</code> mode.
			</p><p>You can also view and edit all your project's strategies using the Strategies Only setting in the Planning View.</p>
