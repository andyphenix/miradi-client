<a href='Definition:IndirectThreat' class='definition'>Indirect threats</a> 
and 
<a href='Definition:IndirectThreat' class='definition'>opportunities</a>
(collectively contributing factors) are the 
economic, cultural, political, legal, social, and/or institutional factors 
that drive direct threats.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Hint: </strong> We use the same shape to represent both indirect 
threats and opportunities because often, a given factor (for example tourism) 
can be both a threat and an opportunity.  Many people find it helpful to focus 
on neutral "factors" rather than trying to classify factors as being positive 
or negative.
