<p><strong>How to Save Files in Miradi</strong></p>

<p>Miradi automatically stores each project on your computer in a named file. Miradi is designed like a database 
	program in which each action is automatically saved to this file as opposed to a word processing or spreadsheet 
	program in which you need to actively save your work. As a result, there is no "save" command in Miradi. 
	Key hints to keep in mind include:</p>
	
<li><strong>All Actions are Automatically Saved</strong> - 
	Any action (for example, moving or cutting a diagram factor) is automatically saved. If you are entering text 
	into a field, it is also automatically saved once you click on another field or close the dialogue box.</li>
<li><strong>Use Undo to Recover Changes</strong> - As a result of this automatic saving, 
	if you make a mistake and want to revert to an earlier version of your file, do <u>not</u> 
	close the project. Instead, use the undo command (on the Edit menu or Ctrl-Z) to undo your actions as needed.</li>
<li><strong>Use "Save Copy As" to Branch a File</strong> - If you want to create a new 
	version of your project while also keeping the old one, then use the <File / Save Copy As> 
	menu command to create a copy of your current project. This is particularly useful if you want to attempt a "risky" change that you may not want to keep.</li>
<li><strong>Use Miradi Zip Files to Store or Share Data</strong> - If you want to store your 
	project or share it with another Miradi user, then use the <File / Export / Miradi Zip File> 
	menu command to create a .mpz file that you can then place on your hard drive or attach to an e-mail.</i>
<li><strong>Use Your Operating System or the Welcome Page to Manage Files</strong> - Miradi stores active files on a special 
	Miradi directory on your computer. For most Windows user, this will be at C:\Documents and Settings\<i>Your User Name</i>\My Documents\Miradi. 
	In this directory, you will see one folder for each Miradi project. You can move, copy, delete, or rename these folders. Remember, 
	however, that the folder itself is the Miradi file. You can also manage these files from the Welcome page of the Miradi program.</li>
