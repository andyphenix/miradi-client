<p>Click on the radio buttons in the Control Bar to <strong>select standard planning views</strong>. 
Alternatively, click on the Create Custom button to <strong>create your own combination</strong> of 
rows and columns.</p>

<p>Miradi creates a tree based on the relationship between goals, objectives, and 
strategies/indicators in your conceptual models and/or results chains. 
Clicking on the + and - symbols enables you to <strong>expand</strong> or 
<strong>collapse</strong> different parts of the hierarchy. 
Selecting a row in the table will allow you to bring up the bottom panel 
and <strong>edit</strong> the information for that row.</p>

<p>Much of the information in the planning view is automatically generated from the diagram. 
To <strong>create</strong> or <strong>delete</strong> a goal, objective, or strategy, 
you have to go the diagram and use the properties dialogue for the relevant factor.</p>
