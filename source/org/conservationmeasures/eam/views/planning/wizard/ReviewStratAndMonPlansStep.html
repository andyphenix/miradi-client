<p>
At this point, you should have already created your draft strategic and monitoring plans 
by assigning specific goals, objectives, strategies, and indicators to specific factors 
in the diagram view.
</p>

<p>
Click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Strategic Plan&gt;</code> or 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Monitoring Plan&gt;</code> radio buttons 
in the Planning View to view and edit these plans.  
You can look at your plans either based on your overall conceptual model, 
or on specific results chains by collapsing and expanding elements of the tree.
</p>

<p>
Note that in your strategic and monitoring plans, 
a given strategy may be repeated several times if it contributes to more than one goal or objective.  
In your work plan, by contrast, strategies are not repeated.
