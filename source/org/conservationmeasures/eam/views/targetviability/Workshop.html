<P>Viability analysis can be a challenging step to accomplish in a workshop 
setting.&nbsp;In a perfect world, defining the basic viability for target 
requires some specialized knowledge about the ecology of that target.&nbsp;As a 
result, people without this knowledge may feel bored or intimated by the 
discussions among the folks who do have the knowledge.</P>
<P>If you have people with expertise in particular targets, you can divide into 
groups and assign each group one or more targets that fit their 
expertise.&nbsp;If you do not have have experts at your workshop, however, you 
may just want to try to quickly block out the basic structure of the viability 
analysis for each target and then try to assemble smaller teams later on to 
complete the analysis.</P>
<P>It is often helpful to use flipcharts to capture the discussion of indicators 
and indicator ratings and then to type this information into Miradi to capture 
it.</P></BODY></HTML>
