<h3>About WWF</h3>

WWF was formed in 1961. It was the product of a deep concern held by a few eminent gentlemen who were worried by what they saw happening in our world at that time. Since those early days WWF has grown to be one of the largest conservation organizations in the world.  Currently there are more than 2000 WWF conservation projects underway around the world. The vast majority of these focus on local issues. They range from school nature gardens in Zambia, to initiatives that appear on the packaging in your local supermarket; from the restoration of orangutan habitats to the establishment of giant panda reserves.
 
<p>In this new millennium WWF continues to improve its to work as focuses on issues that are relevant to people around the world. Our initiatives aim to conserve some of the most important natural places on Earth. In compliment to our placed-based work WWF also focuses efforts on a set of ecologically, economically and culturally important species. WWF believes that targeting efforts to reduce humanity's footprint on our planet so that there are enough natural resources, space and air for people and other forms of life is also of prime concern. In all of our efforts, we try to understand the drivers of change so that our actions are well planned and executed.</p>

<p>All of our work involves partnerships of one sort or another. We team up with local non-profit agencies and other global NGOs. We form relationships with village elders, local councils and regional and national government offices. And in this day and age of globalization, critically, we work with businesses who are willing to change themselves and facilitate change in their sector.</p>
