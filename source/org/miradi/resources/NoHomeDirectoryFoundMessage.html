<p>The home directory @DIRECTORY_NAME@ is not available, the most common reason is that Miradi could not connect to a server that contains this directory.
To use Miradi you must either regain access to that directory or change where Miradi stores its data by going to the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Edit/Preferences/Data&nbsp;Location&gt;</code> tab to specify which drive to use.</p>
