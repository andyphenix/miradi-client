<p>The home directory @DIRECTORY_NAME@ is not available, the most common reason is that Miradi could not connect to a server that contains this directory.
To use Miradi you must either regain access to that directory or change where Miradi stores its data by choosing edit/preferences from the menu and going to the Data location tab.</p>
