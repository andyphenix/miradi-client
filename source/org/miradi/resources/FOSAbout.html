<h1>About FOS</h1>

<p>
Foundations of Success (FOS) is a small, not-for-profit organization 
committed to working with practitioners to learn how to do conservation better 
through the process of adaptive management. 
</p>

<p>
We work with other conservation organizations to help them develop adaptive management systems, 
facilitate cross-project and cross-site learning, and conduct monitoring and evaluation.
