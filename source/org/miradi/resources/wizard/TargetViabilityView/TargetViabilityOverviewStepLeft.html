<h3>Welcome to the Target Viability View</h3>

The target viability view provides an overview of the status of your conservation targets. You can either work on viability target by target from the diagram view, or you can use the tree in this view to see the viability status of all your targets together.

<p class='nextsteps'>If this is your first time doing viability analysis, click next&nbsp;to continue with the viability rating process.</p>

<p>If you have already gone through the Key Attribute-based viability analysis for one or more targets, you can select and edit the key ecological attribute and indicator information here.</p>
