<h3>Explanation of How Target-Threat Ratings Are Calculated</h3>
The first table shows the rule-based procedure for combining the rankings 
<br></br>
for the Scope and Severity variables to get a ranking of 
<a href='none'><em>Threat Magnitude</em></a>.  
<br></br>
Under these rules, if a threat is rated 'low' on either variable, 
then the magnitude is 'low' overall. 
<br></br>
<p>Threat magnitude is then combined with Irreversibility ratings 
using the second table 
<br></br>
to get the Target-Threat Rating.</p>
