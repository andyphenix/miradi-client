Miradi supports two different threat rating systems:

<ul>
<li><strong>Simple Threat Rating</strong> is a system developed by the Conservation Measures Partnership. It involves rating the impact of direct threats on targets.</li><br>
<li><strong>Stress Based Threat Rating</strong> is a system developed by The Nature Conservancy. It involves rating the impact of stresses on a target and then the contribution of sources of stress (direct threats) on each stress.</li>
</ul>

Both methods meet the CMP Open Standards in that they each provide a prioritzed list of direct threats affecting each target. Click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;More&nbsp;Info&gt;</code> button to learn more about the two methods.</p></div>
