<strong>Contribution - </strong>The expected contribution of the source, acting alone, to the full expression of a stress (as determined in the stress assessment) under current circumstances (i.e., given the continuation of the existing management/conservation situation).

<ul>
<li><strong>Very High: </strong>The source is a very large contributor of the particular stress.</li>
<li><strong>High: </strong>The source is a large contributor of the particular stress.</li>
<li><strong>Medium: </strong>The source is a moderate contributor of the particular stress.</li>
<li><strong>Low: </strong>The source is a low contributor of the particular stress.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Irreversibility - </strong>The degree to which the effects of a threat can be restored.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Very High: </strong>The effects of the threat are not reversible (e.g., wetlands converted to a shopping center).</li>
<li><strong>High: </strong>The effects of the threat are technically reversible, but not practically affordable (e.g., wetland converted to agriculture).</li>
<li><strong>Medium: </strong>The effects of the threat are reversible with a reasonable commitment of resources (e.g., ditching and draining of wetland).</li>
<li><strong>Low: </strong>The source is a low contributor of the particular stress.</li>
</ul>
