<strong>Scope - </strong>Most commonly defined spatially as the geographic scope of impact on the conservation target at the site that can reasonably be expected within ten years under current circumstances (i.e., given the continuation of the existing situation).

<ul>
<li><strong>Very High: </strong>The stress is likely to be very widespread or pervasive in its scope, and affect the conservation target throughout the target's occurrences at the site.</li>
<li><strong>High: </strong>The stress is likely to be widespread in its scope, and affect the conservation target at many of its locations at the site.</li>
<li><strong>Medium: </strong>The stress is likely to be localized in its scope, and affect the conservation target at some of the target's locations at the site.</li>
<li><strong>Low: </strong>The stress is likely to be very localized in its scope, and affect the conservation target at a limited portion of the target's location at the site.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Severity - </strong>The level of damage to the conservation target that can reasonably be expected within ten years under current circumstances (i.e., given the continuation of the existing situation).</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Very High: </strong>The stress is likely to destroy or eliminate the conservation target over some portion of the target's occurrence at the site.</li>
<li><strong>High: </strong>The stress is likely to seriously degrade the conservation target over some portion of the target's occurrence at the site.</li>
<li><strong>Medium: </strong>The stress is likely to moderately degrade the conservation target over some portion of the target's occurrence at the site.</li>
<li><strong>Low: </strong>The stress is likely to only slightly impair the conservation target over some portion of the target's occurrence at the site.</li>
</ul>
