<h3>Welcome to the Threat Rating View</h3>

Miradi's default method is the Simple Threat Rating system (see description of the two systems in the right wizard panel). If you want to use the Stress Based Rating system, from the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Edit/Preferences&gt;</code> menu, select the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Threat&nbsp;Rating&nbsp;View&gt;</code> tab. In this tab, change the <strong>Threat Rating Mode</strong> field to <i>"Stress Based Threat Rating Mode."</i>

<p>The table below contains a summary of your threat ratings. Target-Threat combinations that have been rated should appear colored in. If there is a threat or target that is missing, click here to return to the <a href='View:Diagram'>diagram view</a> to add it. If a threat is not linked to a specific target, you can create this by right (alt) clicking on a blank cell in the table (note that this also creates a corresponding link in the diagram).</p> 

<p><strong>Click next to continue with the threat rating process.</strong></p>
