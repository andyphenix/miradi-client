<h3>Welcome to the Miradi Interview & the Summary View!</h3>

As you go through the steps in the CMP Open Standards, this leftside panel of the interview will provide you with step-by-step instructions. The rightside panel will provide definitions and guidance.

<p>The <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Project&gt;</code> tab below provides an overview of your <a href='Definition:Project' class='definition'>project</a>. You can fill in your <b>Project Name</b>, the <b>Project Data Effective Date</b> (the date of your most recent substantive updating of the Miradi project file), and your <b>Project's Website</b> address in the appropriate fields.</p>

<p class='hint'><strong>Hint:</strong>Note that project file name is read only as shown by the grey backround. To edit this field, you have to use the file manager.</p>

<p class='nextsteps'>Click next to define your initial project team.</p>

<p>Later on, you can return to this page and fill in the remaining fields. The <b>Project Description</b> field can be used for a summary or abstract of your project. The <b>Project Status</b> field can be used to generally describe how your project is doing at the moment.  Finally, the <b>Next Steps</b> field can be used to describe any critical next steps; this field is especially useful when you want to send your project file to other team members.</p>
