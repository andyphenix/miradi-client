Successful conservation depends on forging effective partnerships with key stakeholders. Most conservation projects will probably not have sufficient expertise or internal resources to do all the work that needs to be done on their own.  Furthermore, most if not all projects need to ensure that the work that they start will continue after the initial project ends.

<p>To ensure sustainability of the work, you will need to mobilize effective participation and information-sharing with these partners both throughout and beyond the life of the project. This means developing partnerships early on, revisiting them as you move through the cycle, formalizing them as appropriate, and working to maintain positive, supportive relationships.</p>
