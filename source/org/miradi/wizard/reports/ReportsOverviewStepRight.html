<h3>Exporting Data in Miradi to Other Applications</h3>

There are many ways to export your information from Miradi to other applications.

<h4>Export JPEG Image</h4>
Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export/JPEG Image&gt;</code> menu command to capture a specific diagram or table on your screen in an image file. This method is particularly useful to:
<ul>
<li>Put a diagram or table in a document or presentation</li>
<li>Create an image that can be put in a website</li>
</ul>

<h4>Export Miradi Zip File</h4>
Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export/JPEG Image&gt;</code> menu command to capture your entire project in a small zip file. This method is particularly useful to:
<ul>
<li>Send your project to another Miradi user</li>
<li>Create a backup copy of your project</li>
</ul>

<h4>Export Project XML File</h4>
Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export/Project XML File&gt;</code> menu command to create an XML file with all your project data. Although managing the XML file will require technical skills, this method is particularly useful to:
<ul>
<li>Create a file that can be imported by a database</li>
<li>Export all of your project's information into formats that can be read by other applications</li>
</ul>

<h4>Export Tab Delimited Data</h4>
Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export/Tab Delimited Data&gt;</code> menu command to export the currently viewed table to a tab-delimited file. This method is particularly useful to:
<ul>
<li>Export the current configuration from your planning view to a spreadsheet like Excel</li>
<li>Export financial information</li>
</ul>

<h4>Reports View</h4>
Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Reports&gt;</code> view to create a PDF (Adobe Acrobat) or RTF (word processor) file that contains various configurations of your project data. This method is particularly useful to:
<ul>
<li>Create a document that can be edited in a Word Processor</li>
<li>Create a standard report for a donor or other key audience for your project</li>
</ul>
