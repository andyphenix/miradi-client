Type type in the <strong>Name</strong> of your direct threat, and if desired, an <strong>ID</strong> (see hint below). You can also add additional information about the threat in the <strong>Details</strong> and/or <strong>Comments</strong> fields. You should also pick the entry that best describes your threat 
from the <strong>Standard Classification</strong> field that lists a taxonomy of all direct threats in the drop-down menu.

<strong>Hint:</strong> The <strong>Direct Threat ID</strong> field can be used for a short code used to identify and sort your direct threats. One common system is to assign the letters DT and a number to each Direct Threat (e.g., DT1, DT2, etc.)</p><p class='hint'><strong>Hint:</strong> In most Miradi dialogue boxes, the <strong>Details</strong> field is used to record a longer description of the factor, whereas the <strong>Comments</strong> field is meant for discussion about the factor.</p></p>
