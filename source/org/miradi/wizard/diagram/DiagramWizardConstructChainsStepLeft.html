Although for some direct threats there may be only one contributing factor, for 
others, there may be many. The idea is to construct <a href='Definition:Chain' class='definition'>chains</a> showing the sequence of indirect threats and opportunities affecting your threats.

<p>You can add additional factors to the chain by using the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Insert&nbsp;Contributing&nbsp;Factor&gt;</code> button. You can add additional links by selecting one factor, holding the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Shift&gt;</code> key, selecting the second factor, and then clicking on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Insert&nbsp;Link&gt;</code> button (the arrow).</p>

<p>You can also highlight a chain by selecting a direct threat factor, right (alt) clicking the mouse, and picking the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Select&nbsp;Factor&nbsp;Chain&gt;</code> command.</p>
