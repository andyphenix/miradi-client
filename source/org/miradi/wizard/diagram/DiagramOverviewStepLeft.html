<h3>Welcome to the Diagram View</h3>

This view enables you to develop a <a href='Definition:ConceptualModel' class='definition'>conceptual model</a> of your project. A good conceptual model graphically depicts your project's 
<a href='Definition:ConservationTargets' class='definition'>targets</a>, 
<a href='Definition:DirectThreat' class='definition'>direct threats</a>, 
<a href='Definition:IndirectThreat' class='definition'>contributing factors</a>, and 
<a href='Definition:Strategy' class='definition'>strategies</a> - and more importantly, the relationships between
them. As in any modeling exercise, you should not try to show all factors and relationships, but only the most important ones.</p>

<p> This view also helps you to brainstorm strategies and to develop <a href='Definition:ResultsChain' class='definition'>results chains</a> that show the <a href='Definition:IntermediateResult' class='definition'>intermediate results</a> that you assume will be achieved based on the implementation of each strategy. These results chains become the basis for setting <a href='Definition:Objective' class='definition'>objectives</a> and <a href='Definition:Indicator' class='definition'>indicators</a> for your project.</p>
