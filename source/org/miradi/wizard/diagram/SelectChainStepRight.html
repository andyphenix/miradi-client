True strategic planning involves using your conceptual model to determine at what points you will intervene - and also where you will not. The first decision that you have to make in determining your intervention points is to prioritize where in your conceptual model you need to take action. In some cases, the most obvious <strong>intervention point</strong> is the target or direct threat itself.  But in many other cases, you get more leverage if you intervene on some of the indirect threats and opportunities affecting the direct threat - on the chain of factors affecting each direct threat.
