<i>Factor chains</i> are the basic unit for project planning. Consider, for example, the following:

<p><strong>Target: </strong> Montane forest</p>

<p><strong>Direct threat: </strong> Unsustainable logging</p>

<p><strong>Indirect threat: </strong> Government policies promoting unsustainable 
logging</p>

<p><strong>Indirect threat: </strong> Limited awareness within government of 
sustainable logging techniques  (This indirect threat is really an underlying 
cause of the government policies that promote unsustainable logging.)</p>

<p>If you were trying to portray the above relationship in your conceptual model, 
you would link the factors in the following way:</p>
