The next step is identify your <a href='Definition:Strategy' class='definition'>strategies</a>. Strategies are linked to chains of factors showing the sequence of <a href='Definition:IndirectThreat' class='definition'>contributing factors</a> affecting your <a href='Definition:DirectThreat' class='definition'>direct threats</a> and ultimately your <a href='Definition:ConservationTargets' class='definition'>targets</a>.

<p>To select chain that you want to focus on, select a factor in the chain, and the right (alt) click the mouse, picking the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Select&nbsp;Factor&nbsp;Chain&gt;</code> command.  All factors and links in the chain should now be highlighted.  (If you need to add or remove factors from the chain, hold the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</code> key and click on the factors you wish to add or remove.)</p>
			
<p>Next, click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Brainstorm&nbsp;Mode&gt;</code> (available on either the toolbar or by right-clicking the mouse). This should hide all factors except the ones that you have selected.</p>

<p class='hint'><b>Hint:</b> A grey background on the diagram view means that you are showing only a selected chain in brainstorm mode and some factors are hidden.</p>
