Next, you need to add all of your project's <a href='Definition:ConservationTargets' class='definition'> conservation targets</a> to your scope. You should already have one target in your Scope box. You can double click on the green oval representing this target and type in the <strong>Name</strong> of your target, and if desired, an <strong>ID</strong> (see hint below). You can also add additional information about the target in the <strong>Details</strong> and/or <strong>Comments</strong> fields. If it is a species target, you can also record the <strong>Latin Name.</strong>You can also use the <b>Habitat Association</b> field to record the standard name of the system in which a species target is found, or for an ecosystem target itself.

<p>To add additional targets, click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Insert&nbsp;Target&gt;</code> button, select the target and move it to wherever you want it to be, and the double click on it to enter information into the dialogue box.</p>

<p class='hint'><strong>Hint:</strong> The <strong>Target ID</strong> field can be used for a short code used to identify and sort your targets. One common system is to assign a letter to each Target (e.g., A. Coral Reefs, B. Sharks, etc.).</p>

<p class='hint'><strong>Hint:</strong> In most Miradi dialogue boxes, the <strong>Details</strong> field is used to record a longer description of the factor, whereas the <strong>Comments</strong> field is meant for discussion about the factor.</p>
