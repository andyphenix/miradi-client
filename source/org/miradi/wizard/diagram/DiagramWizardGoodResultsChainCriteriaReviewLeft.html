				<P>Once you have completed your results chain, you will want to review the 
				criteria for a good results chain shown on the right. 
				</P>
				
				<P>In particular, you want to make sure that your results chain is results oriented. 
				A common mistake with developing results chains is to list all 
				the activities that your team must undertake to implement your strategy. This 
				produces an implementation chain, not a results chain. An implementation chain 
				does not show the causal logic that connects a strategy to a desired 
				conservation impact. As such, it does not provide you with an idea of the 
				assumptions you need to test in order to know whether your strategy is working 
				or not.</P>
				
				<P>You next can either develop objectives for your project based on your results 
				chain, work on another results chain, or go on to develop your monitoring 
				plan.</P>
