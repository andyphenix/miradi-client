A <i>vision statement</i> is a general summary of the desired state or ultimate condition of the project area that a project is working to achieve. A good vision statement meets the criteria of being:
<ul>
<li><strong>Relatively General</strong> - Broadly defined to encompass a broad range of potential project activities.</li>
<li><strong>Visionary</strong> - Inspirational in outlining the desired change in the state of the targets toward which the project is working.</li>
<li><strong>Brief</strong> - Simple and succinct so that all project participants can remember it.</li>
</ul>
