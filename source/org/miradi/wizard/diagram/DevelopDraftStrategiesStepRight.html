A <i>strategy</i> describes a group of actions with a common focus that work together to reduce threats, capitalize on opportunities, or restore natural systems.  A good strategy meets the criteria of being:
          	
<ul>
<li><strong>Linked -</strong> Directly affects one or more critical factors</li>          
<li><strong>Focused -</strong> Outlines specific courses of action to be carried out</li>
<li><strong>Feasible -</strong> Accomplishable in light of the project's resources and constraints</li>
<li><strong>Appropriate -</strong> Acceptable to and falling within site-specific cultural, social, and biological norms</p></li>
</ul>
          	
<p>A <i>draft strategy</i> is one that you have brainstormed, but not yet decided to implement.</p>
