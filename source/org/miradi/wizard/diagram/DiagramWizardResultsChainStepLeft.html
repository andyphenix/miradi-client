<a href='Definition:Chain' class='definition'>Results chains</a> are a key tool for developing strategies. To begin, click on a strategy in the diagram. Next, click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Create&nbsp;Results&nbsp;Chain&gt;</code> button, available either on the toolbar or by right (alt) clicking the mouse. This will create a new tab in the diagram window that has the strategy and linked factors on it.

<p>You can include multiple factors in your new results chain by selecting them before clicking the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Create&nbsp;Results&nbsp;Chain&gt;</code> button.</p>

<p>If there is a chain icon shown in a strategy hexagon, you can view the existing results-chain by either clicking on the appropriate tab or by clicking on the strategy and then using the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Show&nbsp;Results&nbsp;Chain&gt;</code> button, available either on the toolbar or by right (alt) clicking the mouse.</p>
