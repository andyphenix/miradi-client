Once you have developed your draft strategies, you rate each one in terms of its <b>Potential Impact</b> and <b>Feasibility</b> by double clicking on a draft strategy and using the drop-down ratings in the dialog box.

<p>Once you have developed all your draft strategies, you can decide which one(s) you want to carry forward. Unchecking <b>Draft</b> in the status field in the dialogue box will convert the strategy from a light yellow "draft strategy" to a dark yellow "strategy."</p>

<p>Click the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Show&nbsp;Full&nbsp;Diagram&gt;</code> button (available at the bottom of the screen, the toolbar ,or by right (alt) clicking the mouse) to go back to the full model and hide all your draft strategies. Note that your draft strategies are still retained in <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Brainstorm&nbsp;Mode&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>You can also view and edit all your project's strategies using the <i>"Strategies Only"</i> setting in the Planning View.</p>
