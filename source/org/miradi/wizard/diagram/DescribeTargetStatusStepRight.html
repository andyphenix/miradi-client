Assigning one rating to represent the overall status of most conservation targets is a difficult task that involves making many assumptions. As a general rule, this rating process involves determining one or more attributes and/or indicators that represent the health of the target and then assessing the status of these indicators against a predetermined rating scale:

<ul>
<li><strong>Very Good - </strong>Ecologically desirable status; requires little intervention for maintenance.</li>
<li><strong>Good - </strong>Within acceptable range of variation; some intervention required for maintenance.</li>
<li><strong>Fair - </strong> Outside acceptable range of variation; requires human intervention.</li>
<li><strong>Poor - </strong>Restoration increasingly difficult; may result in extirpation of target. If your assessment of a target involves more than one attributes/indicators, then you need to combine these ratings to get an overall rating for the target.</li>
</ul>
