A <i>results chain</i> is a tool that clarifies assumptions about how conservation activities are believed to contribute to reducing threats and achieving the conservation of biodiversity or thematic targets. They are diagrams that map out a series of causal statements that link factors in an "if...then" fashion - for example, if a threat is reduced, then a biodiversity target is enhanced or if an opportunity is taken, then a thematic target might be improved. In some organizations, results chains are also termed logic models.

<p>The basis for a results chain comes from factor chains from your conceptual model, but you will build on those factor chains to make them more specific and to change the boxes from neutral factors describing the current state of the world to results you want to see. As shown below, results chains are composed of a strategy, desired outcomes including <a href='Definition:IntermediateResult' class='definition'>intermediate results</a> and <a href='Definition:ThreatReductionResult' class='definition'>threat reduction results</a>, and the ultimate impact that these results will have on the biodiversity target.</p>
