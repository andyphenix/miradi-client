At this point, you should have already created your draft strategic plan by assigning specific goals, objectives, and strategies to specific factors in the diagram view.

<p>Click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Strategic&nbsp;Plan&gt;</code> radio button in the Planning View to view and edit this plan. You can look at your plans either based on your overall conceptual model, or on specific results chains by collapsing and expanding elements of the tree.</p>

<p>Note that in your strategic plan, a given strategy may be repeated several times if it contributes to more than one goal or objective. (In your work plan, by contrast, strategies are not repeated.) If you want to adjust which strategy is tied to a given objective, click on the objective in the upper tree table. In the panel below, click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Choose&nbsp;Strategies&gt;</code> button and check which strategies you would like to have associated with this objective.</p>

<p>For a selected strategy, you can also use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Edit&nbsp;Progress&nbsp;Report&gt;</code> button to update the status of a given indicator.</p>
