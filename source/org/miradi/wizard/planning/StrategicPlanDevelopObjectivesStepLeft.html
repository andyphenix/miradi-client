			factors in a model. Objectives can be either created in a conceptual model or in a results chain. Some people like to create them before they have identified their strategies; other people like to develop them after they have their strategies.</p>  <p>To create a new objective, double 
			click on a factor and then click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;objectives&gt;</code> tab 
			in the properties dialogue box. Click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;create objective&gt;</code> button 
			at the side of the page.  Fill in the following fields:</p>
			
			<ul>
			  <li>
			    <p><strong>Short Label:</strong> The text that will appear in the objective symbol on the diagram.  
			    Often a letter and number combination (e.g., "A1" or "D3").</p>
			  </li>
			  <li>
			   <p><strong>Objective:</strong> The title of the objective.  Generally 3-5 words (e.g., Reduce Shark Fishing) </p>
			  </li>
			  <li>
			    <p><strong>Full Text:</strong> The complete objective statement.</p>
			  </li>
			</ul> 
			
			<p>If you want to use an existing objective from another target, click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;clone objective&gt;</code> button and follow the instructions.To edit or delete an objective, 
			click on the desired row and then either edit 
			the text in the box at the bottom or click on the
