At this point, you should have already created your draft monitoring plan by assigning indicators to specific factors in the diagram view.

<p>Click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Monitoring Plan&gt;</code> radio button in the Planning View to view and edit this plan. You can look at your plans either based on your overall conceptual model, or on specific results chains by collapsing and expanding elements of the tree.</p>

<p>Note that in your monitoring plan, a given indicator may be repeated several times if it contributes to more than one goal or objective. (In your work plan, by contrast, indicators are not repeated.) If you want to adjust which indicator is tied to a given objective, click on the objective in the upper tree table. In the panel below, click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Choose&nbsp;Indicators&gt;</code> button and check which indicators you would like to have associated with this objective.</p>

<p>For a selected indicator, you can use the lower panel to assign or edit the <a href='Definition:Method' class='definition'>method</a> and the <a href='Definition:PriorityRating' class='definition'>priority rating</a>. You can also use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Edit&nbsp;Progress&nbsp;Report&gt;</code> button to update the status of a given indicator.</p>
