An <i>objective</i> is a formal statement detailing a desired outcome of a project, such as reducing a critical threat. If the project is well conceptualized and designed, realization of a project's objectives should lead to the fulfillment of the project's goals and ultimately its vision. A good objective meets the criteria of being:
          
<ul>
<li><strong>Outcome Oriented -</strong> Represents necessary changes in critical threat and opportunity factors that affect one or more project goals </li>          
<li><strong>Time Limited -</strong> Achievable within a specific period of time</li>          
<li><strong>Measurable -</strong> Definable in relation to some standard scale (numbers, percentage, fractions, or all/nothing states)</li>          
<li><strong>Specific -</strong> Clearly defined so that all people involved in the project have the same understanding of what the terms in the objective mean</li>          
<li><strong>Practical -</strong> Achievable and appropriate within the context of the project site   </li>          
</ul>
