To assign an existing resource to an activity/method or task, in the Planning View, click on the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Work&nbsp;Plan&gt;</code> radio button and select an activity/method or task that you want to focus on. Click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Add&nbsp;Resource&gt;</code> button and use the drop down box to select the appropriate human or material resource (do not include financial resources here). You can specify the number of units for the resource in each upcoming quarter in the orange columns.

<p>You can add multiple resources to one activity or task if necessary. You can also assign resources at either the overall activity or task level for a given activity, but you cannot do both.</p>
