<h3>Welcome to the Planning View</h3>

This view enables you to develop and edit various plans for your project.  
Standard planning views include:

<p><b>Strategic Plan</b> - A plan for how your project will change the project situation. 
Shows the relationship between a project's 
<a href='Definition:Goal' class='definition'>goals</a>, 
<a href='Definition:Objective' class='definition'>objectives</a>, and 
<a href='Definition:Strategy' class='definition'>strategies</a>.</p>

<p><b>Monitoring Plan</b> - A plan for collecting information that you and others need to know about your project. 
Includes the 
<a href='Definition:Indicator' class='definition'>indicators</a> 
that you will track over time as well as the 
<a href='Definition:Method' class='definition'>methods</a> 
that you will use.</p>

<p><b>Work Plan</b> - A description of the specific 
<a href='Definition:Activity' class='definition'>activities</a>/<a href='Definition:Method' class='definition'>methods</a> and

that you need to undertake your strategic and monitoring plans. 
Shows the timing and sequence of each task as well as the specific 
<a href='Definition:Resource' class='definition'>resources</a>
