			This view currently enables you to develop a 
			<a href='Definition:Budget' class='definition'>budget</a> for your project (in the future, it will also 
			enable you to manage <a href='Definition:ActualExpenditures' class='definition'>actual expenditures</a>).  
			A budget shows the costs and funding sources for the 
			<a href='Definition:Activity' class='definition'>activities</a>/<a href='Definition:Method'  class='definition'>methods</a> and 
			<a href='Definition:Task' class='definition'>tasks</a> that you need to 
			undertake to implement your strategic and monitoring 
			plans for each <a href='Definition:Quarter' class='definition'>quarter</a>.

				<strong>Hint:</strong>The budget view takes the same 
				table that you developed in your work plan and adds 
				a financial dimension to it.
