Indicators are linked to factors in a model.  
If you used the detailed method of viability analysis, you have already created 
indicators for your targets. The information on this page is not applicable for targets
set to use the detailed method. 
However, you should create indicators for other factors, where appropriate.

To create a new 
<a href='Definition:Indicator' class='definition'>indicator</a>, 
double click on a factor and then click on the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Indicators&gt;</code>
 tab in the properties dialogue box. Click on the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Create Indicator&gt;</code>
