Just as each <a href='Definition:Strategy' class='definition'>strategy</a> will have one or more <a href='Definition:Activity' class='definition'>activities</a> associated with it, each monitoring <a href='Definition:Indicator' class='definition'>indicator</a> will also have one or more <a href='Definition:Method' class='definition'>methods</a> associated with it.

<p>In the Planning View, click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Work&nbsp;Plan&gt;</code> radio button and select an indicator that you want to focus on. Think about the specific methods that you will have to undertake to measure this indicator. Click on the 
<code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Create Method&gt;</code> button to add a new method and then type the name of the method in the label box in the bottom panel. If necessary, you can have multiple methods for each indicator. Repeat for other indicators as needed. You can use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Move&nbsp;Item&nbsp;Up&gt;</code> and the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Move&nbsp;Item&nbsp;Down&gt;</code> buttons to change the order.</p>

<p>If necessary, you can also highlight a method and click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Create&nbsp;Task&gt;</code> button to add <a href='Definition:Task' class='definition'>tasks</a> under this method. (If you are really detail oriented, you can even create sub-tasks and sub-sub tasks under a task.)</p>
