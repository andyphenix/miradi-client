<p><a href='Definition:Goal' class='definition'>Goals</a> are linked to targets.  
			If you used the basic method of viability analysis, then you will need to create your goals from scratch.  If you used the Key Attribute method of viability analysis, you have already created specific goals
			for your targets, but you will want to create a more general goal based on these specific ones.</p>
			<p>
			To create a new goal, double 
			click on a target and then click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;goals&gt;</code>
			tab in the properties dialogue box.  
			Click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;create goal&gt;</code> button at the side of the page.  
			Fill in the following fields:</p>
			
			<ul>
			  <li>
			    <p><strong>Short Label:</strong>  The text that will appear 
			    	in the goal symbol on the diagram.  Often a letter (e.g., "A" or "D").</p>
			  </li>
			  <li>
			   <p><strong>Goal:</strong>  The title of the goal.  Generally 3-5 words (e.g., Maintain Seabird Populations) </p>
			  </li>
			  <li>
			    <strong>Full Text:</strong>  The complete goal statement.
			  </li>
			</ul> 
			<br></br>
		If you want to use an existing goal from another target, click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;clone goal&gt;</code> button and follow the instructions.	To edit or delete a goal, 
			click on the desired row and then either edit 
			the text in the box at the bottom or click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;delete goal&gt;</code> button.
  <p>You can also view and edit all your project's goals using the Goals Only setting in the Planning View.</p>
