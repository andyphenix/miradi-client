<h3>Why Do Viability Analysis?</h3>
Viability analysis asks you to look at each of your conservation targets carefully to determine how to measure its &quot;health&quot; over time. And then to identify how the target is doing today and what a &quot;healthy state&quot; might look like. This step is the key to knowing which of your targets are most in need of immediate attention, and for measuring success over time.&nbsp;Click on the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;More Info&gt;</code> button to get additional detail about viability analysis.<br><br>

<h3>Navigation Hints for the Target Viability View</h3>
The Viability Table will give you an overview of the viability status of each target. To <span class='task'>see details about a target or its attributes</span>, click the appropriate line on the table and the details will appear in the panel below.<br>

<p class='hint'><b>Hint:</b>Simple viability mode targets cannot be edited from this view - go to the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Viability&gt;</code> tab in the target properties for each target in the diagram view.</p>
