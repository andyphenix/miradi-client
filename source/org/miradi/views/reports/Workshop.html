<h3>Exporting Workshop Data in Miradi to Other Applications</h3>
Although you may not want to use Miradi to <i>display</i> information in a workshop, it is a very useful way to <i>capture</i> the information put on a sticky board or a flip chart so that it can be documented and shared with other workshop participants.  There are many ways to export your information from Miradi to other applications.<br>

<h4>Export Images</h4>
Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export/JPEG Image&gt;</code> or <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export/PNG Image&gt;</code> menu commands  to capture a specific diagram or table on your screen in an image file. This method is particularly useful to:
<ul>
<li>Put a diagram or table in a document or presentation</li>
<li>Create an image that can be put in a website</li>
</ul>

<h4>Export Miradi Zip File</h4>
Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export/Miradi Project Zipfile&gt;</code> menu command to capture your entire project in a small zip file. This method is particularly useful to:
<ul>
<li>Send your project to another Miradi user</li>
<li>Create a backup copy of your project</li>
</ul>

<h4>Export Project XML File</h4>
Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export/Project XML File&gt;</code> menu command to create an XML file with all your project data. Although managing the XML file will require technical skills, this method is particularly useful to:
<ul>
<li>Create a file that can be imported by a database</li>
<li>Export all of your project's information into formats that can be read by other applications</li>
</ul>

<h4>Export Tab Delimited Data</h4>
Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;File/Export/Tab Delimited Data&gt;</code> menu command to export the currently viewed table to a tab-delimited file. This method is particularly useful to:
<ul>
<li>Export the current configuration from your planning view to a spreadsheet like Excel</li>
<li>Export financial information</li>
</ul>

<h4>Generate Reports</h4>
Use the <code class='toolbarbutton'>&lt;Reports&gt;</code> view to create a PDF (Adobe Acrobat) or ODT (Open Office) file that contains various configurations of your project data. This method is particularly useful to:
<ul>
<li>Create a document that can be edited in the Open Office Word Processor</li>
<li>Create a standard report for a donor or other key audience for your project</li>
</ul>
