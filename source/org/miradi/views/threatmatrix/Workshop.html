<H3>Overview</H3>
<P>Threat ratings are generally best done by sending project teams into breakout 
groups. If you are doing a large complex project, you can also assign each 
breakout group to develop and then rate the threats for one or two targets.</P>
<P>As a general rule, we recommend that you follow the threat rating process 
outlined in the interview screen, but that you do it using a sticky board and 
flip chart (you can recreate the table below for each target on one page of a 
flip chart). You should either have a recorder using Miradi in the back of the 
room typing the numbers in, or you can enter the numbers after the session end. 
If you are not typing in the ratings, you can convert ratings into numbers (VH = 
4, H = 3, M = 2, and L =1) and then add them up to get an approximation of the 
rolled-up ratings.</P>

Procedure for Breakout Groups</H3>
<P>The following is the procedure for both identifying and then rating direct 
threats. Each breakout group will be assigned one or two targets. As a group, 
for each target you should:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>Write your target on a card and place it on the far right of your 
  workspace. 
  <LI>Brainstorm specific direct threats that could potentially affect your 
  target (try not to include "indirect threats" or "stresses"). Consult the 
  IUCN-CMP classification if necessary. 
  <LI>Put each direct threat on a card and put it to the left of your target, 
  linking it to the relevant threat(s). If necessary, you can also identify 
  stresses/attributes. 
  <LI>Discuss the direct threats and if necessary, combine, split, remove, or 
  add cards. 
  <LI>Go through steps 1-4 for your remaining targets. 
  <LI>Put each direct threat on a new index card and bring it to the plenary 
  session. At this session, we will then make sure all groups are considering 
  the same direct threats. 
  <LI>Return to your breakout group and revise your list of direct threats based 
  on the plenary discussion. 
  <LI>Rate each direct threat according to the criteria of scope, severity, and 
  irreversibility. Make sure you record your ratings, using the following 
  table.</LI></OL>

Criteria for Direct Threat Ratings</H3>
<P><STRONG>Scope</STRONG> – Most commonly defined spatially as the geographic 
scope of impact on the conservation target at the site that can reasonably be 
expected within 10 years under current circumstances (i.e., given the 
continuation of the existing situation).</P>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Very High:</STRONG> The direct threat is likely to be very 
  widespread or pervasive in its scope, and affect the conservation target 
  throughout the target’s occurrences at the site. 
  <LI><STRONG>High:</STRONG> The direct threat is likely to be widespread in its 
  scope, and affect the conservation target at many of its locations at the 
  site. 
  <LI><STRONG>Medium:</STRONG> The direct threat is likely to be localized in 
  its scope, and affect the conservation target at some of the target’s 
  locations at the site. 
  <LI><STRONG>Low:</STRONG> The direct threat is likely to be very localized in 
  its scope, and affect the conservation target at a limited portion of the 
  target’s location at the site.</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>Severity</STRONG> – The level of damage to the conservation target 
that can reasonably be expected within 10 years under current circumstances 
(i.e., given the continuation of the existing situation).</P>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Very High:</STRONG> The direct threat is likely to destroy or 
  eliminate the conservation target over some portion of the target’s occurrence 
  at the site. 
  <LI><STRONG>High:</STRONG> The direct threat is likely to seriously degrade 
  the conservation target over some portion of the target’s occurrence at the 
  site. 
  <LI><STRONG>Medium:</STRONG> The direct threat is likely to moderately degrade 
  the conservation target over some portion of the target’s occurrence at the 
  site. 
  <LI><STRONG>Low:</STRONG> The direct threat is likely to only slightly impair 
  the conservation target over some portion of the target’s occurrence at the 
  site.</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>Irreversibility</STRONG> – The degree to which the effects of a 
direct threat can be restored. Note that irreversibility refers to the "effects 
of the direct threat on the target" not the direct threat itself – you can think 
of it as the "recoverability" of the target from the effects of the threat.</P>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Very High:</STRONG> The effects of the direct threat are not 
  reversible (e.g., wetlands converted to a shopping center). 
  <LI><STRONG>High:</STRONG> The effects of the direct threat are reversible, 
  but not practically affordable (e.g., wetland converted to agriculture). 
  <LI><STRONG>Medium:</STRONG> The effects of the direct threat are reversible 
  with a reasonable commitment of resources (e.g., ditching and draining of 
  wetland). 
  <LI><STRONG>Low:</STRONG> The effects of the direct threat are easily 
  reversible at relatively low cost (e.g., off-road vehicles trespassing in 
  wetland). </LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
