<P>Conservation must take place in the face of a wide variety of threats. A 
common challenge for conservation practitioners is determining which of these 
threats they will try to address. Often, decisions are made applying an implicit 
set of criteria to evaluate threats. The danger with this approach is that 
different people might use different criteria or apply them differently. 
Moreover, there is a tendency to address threats for which strategies and 
expertise already exist, rather than addressing those that are posing the 
greatest threat to the biodiversity at a site.</P>
<P>Threat ranking is a method for making this implicit step more explicit and 
more objective. It basically involves determining and defining a set of criteria 
and then applying those criteria systematically to the direct threats to a 
project area so that conservation actions can be directed where they are most 
needed. Different organizations have developed their own variations of this 
basic threat rating procedures.</P>

Threat Rating System Used in Miradi</H3>
<P>The Miradi software currently uses a threat rating system developed by The 
Nature Conservancy, WWF, and Foundations of Success (the "Rapid CAP" approach). 
More information about this system can be found in:</P>

Other Related Threat Rating Systems</H3>
<P>One of the earliest threat rating systems was developed by The Nature 
Conservancy as part of it’s 5-S process. This system involves dividing direct 
threats into "stresses" and "sources" of stress and then rating their effects on 
each target. More information is available at:</P>

<P>Another early approach was developed by the Biodiversity Support Program. 
This system involves rating threats relative to one another across an entire 
project area. Variants of this system are also used by WCS’s Living Landscapes 
Program. More information is available at:</P>
