<H3>An Overview of Threat Ratings</H3>
Conservation must take place in the face of a wide variety of threats. A common challenge for conservation practitioners is determining which of these threats they will try to address. Often, decisions are made applying an implicit set of criteria to evaluate threats. The danger with this approach is that different people might use different criteria or apply them differently. Moreover, there is a tendency to address threats for which strategies and 
expertise already exist, rather than addressing those that are posing the greatest threat to the biodiversity at a site.<br>

<P>Threat ranking is a method for making this implicit step more explicit and more objective. It basically involves determining and defining a set of criteria and then applying those criteria systematically to the direct threats to a 
project area so that conservation actions can be directed where they are most needed. Different organizations have developed their own variations of this basic threat rating procedures.</P>

<H3>Simple Threat Rating System</H3>
Miradi software currently uses a threat rating system developed by The Nature Conservancy, WWF, and Foundations of Success (the "Simple Threat Rating" approach). More information about this system can be found in:<br>

<H3>Stress-Based Threat Rating System</H3>
Miradi also supports another threat rating system that was developed by The Nature Conservancy as part of its 5-S process. This system involves dividing direct threats into "stresses" and "sources" of stress and then rating their effects on each target. More information is available at:<br>

<H3>Other Threat Rating Systems</H3>
Another early approach was developed by the Biodiversity Support Program. This system involves rating threats relative to one another across an entire project area. Variants of this system are also used by WCSâ€™s Living Landscapes Program. More information is available at:<br>
