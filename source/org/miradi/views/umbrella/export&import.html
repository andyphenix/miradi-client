Preview of Coming Attractions</FONT></B></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Miradi is stand-alone desktop software.&nbsp; But we 
recognize that project teams will need to both import data from and export data 
to many different sources.&nbsp; Some of the key functions we hope to create 
include:</FONT></P>
<H3>
<HR>
Configure Export</H3>
<P><FONT face=Arial>This command will enable you to define what parts of your 
project file you want to share with other people.&nbsp; For example, when 
uploading your project to a public database, you may wish to not upload 
financial data or information about the locations of&nbsp;sensitive 
species.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>We hope to make Miradi "fully granular" in configuring what 
to export.&nbsp; We also will provide a way to encrypt or otherwise protect 
sensitive information.&nbsp; Benetech has lots of experience with this sort of 
requirement from its work with the Martus Human Rights software.</FONT></P>
<H3>
<HR>
Export</H3>
<P><FONT face=Arial>This command will enable you to export your data to many 
different sources.&nbsp; For example, you might wish to export:</FONT></P>
<UL>
  <LI><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>Financial Data</STRONG> - You might want send 
  your budget or actual expenditures on a quarterly basis to your organization's 
  accounting system, thus keeping the bean counters happy.&nbsp;</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>Project Summary Data&nbsp;</STRONG>- You might 
  also want to regularly upload your project's summary data to your 
  organization's database of projects.&nbsp; Imagine the convenience of not 
  having to "double-enter" information into a website, but instead having it 
  come straight from the software you are already using to manage your 
  project.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>Donor Applications and Reports</STRONG> - Most 
  conservation projects have to write half-a-dozen or more funding proposals 
  each year, and even more reports on the grants that they 
  have.&nbsp;&nbsp;Typically these&nbsp;applications and reports require similar 
  data (project goals, objectives, monitoring results), but in different 
  formats.&nbsp; If we can get pre-load the templates for the applications 
  and&nbsp;reports&nbsp;for major donors into Miradi, it should be possible to 
  then export your project information into a word&nbsp;processor file that can 
  then be lightly edited and sent to the donors.&nbsp; And just maybe someday, 
  we can even convince some donors to directly 
  accept&nbsp;Miradi&nbsp;Project&nbsp;files as&nbsp;reports 
  themselves!&nbsp;</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>Project Results and Lessons Learned</STRONG> - 
  There are many project teams around the world who undoubtedly could benefit 
  from your experiences and the lessons you have learned.&nbsp; We hope to 
  create a series of linked databases that would then house information 
  contributed by projects from around the world.&nbsp; These databases would be 
  the ultimate foundation for cross-project learning.</FONT></LI></UL>
<H3>
<HR>
Import</H3>
<P><FONT face=Arial>This command will enable you to import data&nbsp;from many 
different sources.&nbsp; For example, you might wish to import:</FONT></P>
<UL>
  <LI><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>Basic Project Information</STRONG> - Information 
  from another program.</FONT></LI>
  <LI><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>Financial Data</STRONG> - Budget information from 
  an Excel spreadsheet.</FONT></LI>
  <LI><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>Maps</STRONG> - Base geographical maps created in 
  a GIS program.</FONT></LI></UL>
