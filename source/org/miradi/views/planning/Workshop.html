<H3>Planning in a Workshop</H3>
Developing a strategic or monitoring plan can work reasonably well in a workshop format. In particular, results chains are a very powerful tool for discussing your strategies, objectives, and indicators. Developing the details of your plan, however, is often best done by smaller groups of team members working in parallel sessions.<br>
