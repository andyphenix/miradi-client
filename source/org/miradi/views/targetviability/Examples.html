Examples for&nbsp;Viability Analysis</H3>
<P>Viability analysis sometimes seems to be very detailed and technical. Often, 
project teams get stuck trying to come up with perfect benchmarks of target 
health, especially when the scientific information needed to establish these 
benchmarks is often lacking or inadequate. In these cases, project teams should 
rely on general ecological concepts, comparisons to other similar systems, 
well-informed expert opinion – or failing that, the team members’ best estimate 
– to determine a "credible first iteration" of the benchmarks and assessment of 
the current rating.</P>
<P>For the initial planning, it is often sufficient to describe the benchmarks 
for Good and Fair, since this distinction is the most important for determining 
the need for management actions. As shown in the following example, if you treat 
this as the first step in an iterative process, you can almost always put some 
initial thinking down. Identifying gaps and weaknesses in existing knowledge is 
also crucial to help you spur investigations to improve the state of knowledge 
about your focal targets.</P>
<P>For example, suppose a project team is working on a project with a grassland 
target. They decide that one of the key ecological attributes is fire regime and 
the indicator of the fire regime is fire frequency. They know that the grassland 
that they are responsible for managing is full of woody species and the grasses 
and forbs are not flowering well and they haven’t seen some grassland nesting 
bird species in a few years. As a result, they are pretty certain that the 
grassland needs to burn, but they don’t know how frequently the grassland would 
burn in a natural state. So in their first pass, the team fills out the 
viability rating scale as follows:</P>
<P><IMG 
src="images/TargetViability/viability_example_1.png"  height=207  width=695
border=0></P>
<P>This team has defined Fair as being "fire not frequent enough" and Good as 
being "fire frequent enough." This is perfectly acceptable for their first 
attempt. Later, the team locates a local grassland expert. She tells them that 
fire should occur every 5-10 years to maintain the structure of this type of 
grassland. This additional information enables them to fill out the table 
as:</P>
<P><IMG 
src="images/TargetViability/viability_example_2.png"   height=210  width=696
border=0></P>
<P>Reviewing the literature and consulting with experts, the team comes to 
realize, however, that it is not just the presence of fire anywhere on the site 
that matters, but that a sufficient portion of the site should burn on a regular 
interval. To this end, over a few years, the team does some more research about 
the frequency of fires and they redefine their indicator and ratings as 
follows:</P>
<P><IMG 
src="images/TargetViability/viability_example_3.png"   height=211  width=694
border=0></P>
<P>Any of the above outcomes is acceptable for a first iteration of your 
viability analysis depending on the level of information available.</P></FONT>
