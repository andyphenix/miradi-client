* Add a new Test class

1. In the Eclipse Package Explorerer, highlight the appropriate package.

2. Right-click, New Junit Test Case

3. Name it TestXxxYyy where XxxYyy is the name of the class you will be testing

4. After the test class has been created, change it to extend EAMTestCase

5. Organize imports, then use the light bulb to have it automatically create
the constructor. Delete the //TODO comment.

6. Create a testBasics method:

	public void testBasics() throws Exception
	{
		fail();
	}

7. Run MainTests, which should pass all tests because this one isn't being 
executed yet. (If any tests fail, fix them before proceeding).

8. Edit MainTests.java and add this new test to the suite where appropriate

9. Re-run MainTests and see that this new test fails.

10. Delete the testBasics method and start creating your own test methods

===============================================================================
* Add a data field to an EAMObject class

1. Find the Test class for the object class you intend to modify, such as
    TestIndicator.java
    
2. If the Test class does not extend ObjectTestCase, do the following:

   a. Make it extend ObjectTestCase instead of EAMTestCase
   b. Add a final int type member variable initialized to the appropriate type
      (a constant from the ObjectType class)

3. If the Test class does not already have a testData() method, add it

4. If the field you are adding is not a String or IdList type, ObjectTestCase 
   will need to be enhanced before you can continue.
   
5. Add a line to testData for the field you intend to add, such as:
     verifyTextField(type, XxxYyy.TAG_ZZZ)
   where XxxYyy is your object class, and ZZZ is the new field identifier
   
6. To fix the compile error, add TAG_ZZZ to the object class

7. Run the test to ensure that it fails

8. In the object class:

   a. Create a new member variable, something like:
        StringData zzz;
   b. If the objec class does not already have a clear() method, add it
      by overriding clear() from the superclass
   c. In clear(), add a line that initializes the new data member:
        zzz = new StringData();
   d. In clear(), add a line that adds this field to the list:
        addField(TAG_ZZZ, zzz);
        
9. Run the tests. They should pass.
