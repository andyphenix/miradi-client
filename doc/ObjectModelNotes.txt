=====================================================

CONCEPTUAL MODEL:

Scope
  Target
    DirectThreat/IndirectThreat/Opportunity
      Strategy (aka Intervention or Hexagon)

Scope contains targets
Relationships between others can be many-to-many
Aside from Interventions, represents the state of the world BEFORE
  our project has effects
Indicators can be attached to any node (Target, 
  DirectThreat/IndirectThreat/Opportunity, or Strategy)
      
=====================================================

BLUE WORLD

Vision (tied to scope)
  Goal (tied to target)
    Objective (tied to Threat/Factor/Opportunity)
    Outcome (possibly the same as an Objective?)
    
Represents the desired results of our project
Achieving Objectives leads to achieving Goals leads to realizing Vision
A Vision/Goal/Objective can be referred to as a "Result"


=====================================================
STRATEGIC PLAN

  Objective
    Strategy
      Activity
        Task

Some Strategies may serve more than one Objective. We will 
  visually indicate this "sharing".

=====================================================
MONITORING PLAN

  Indicator
    Strategy
      Activity
        Tasks

Some Strategies may serve more than one Indicator. We will 
  visually indicate this "sharing".

=====================================================
WORK PLAN

  ACTION PLAN
    Strategy+Objective
      Activity
        Task
          Subtask
    
   

Conceptually, Strategies are linked to Objectives
  For now, each Strategy may have only one Objective, and 
  each Objective can have only one Strategy.
Conceptually, and Indicators are linked to Objectives. We haven't
  re-discussed many-to-many relationships
"Indicator" here refers to the bundle of data surrounding the actual 
  indicator, which is technically just a measured data point
Strategies, Objectives, and Indicators serve as the linkages between 
  the Conceptual Model and the Work Plan.
