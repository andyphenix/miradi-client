<h3>1. Project files</h3>
    
      A project in install4j is the collection of all information required to build media files.
      A project is saved to a single XML file with an <i><tt>.install4j</tt></i> extension. Project files
      are platform-independent, you can open and compile them on any supported platform.
      Any paths that you enter in install4j are saved as absolute paths by default. This allows you
      to move the project file to a different location on your computer and the compilation will still work.
      If you wish to use your project file on multiple computers or platforms or compile your launchers by automatic
      build agents, it is more convenient to use relative paths. install4j provides an option to
      <a href="../../../doc/steps/general/projectOptions.html">convert all paths to relative paths</a>
      when you save your project.
    <br>
    
<p>
      install4j keeps a list of recently opened projects under <i>Project-&gt;Reopen</i>.
      By default, install4j opens the last project on startup. This behavior can be changed in the
      <a href="../../../doc/preferences.html">preferences dialog</a>.
      You can pass the name of a project file as a command line parameter to install4j to open it on startup.
      Also, the <a href="../../../doc/cli/cli.html">command line compiler</a> expects the project file name as its argument.
    </p>
    
<h3>2. Contents of a project</h3>
    
<p>
      The following paragraphs give a high-level overview of the elements that you can configure in install4j.
      Each of the configuration sections in install4j as seen in the screenshot below represents
      a top-level concept in install4j.
    </p>
    
<p>
      
<img style="vertical-align: middle" align="middle" border="0" src="../../../doc/images/main_window.png">
    </p>
    
<p>
      Typically, a project defines the distribution of a single application. An application has an automatically
      generated <a href="../../../doc/steps/installerGui/updateOptions.html">application ID</a> that allows installers
      to recognize previous installations.
    </p>
    
<p>
      At the core of the project definition is the sequence of
      <a href="../../../doc/helptopics/concepts/screensAndActions.html">installer screens and actions</a>. They
      determine what the users see, what information they can enter and what the installer does.
      install4j offers a lot of flexibility regarding the configuration of of your installer. Besides creating traditional
      application installers, install4j is equally suited
      to create small applications that modify the target system in some way.
      The install4j runtime is localized into many languages. You can configure your installers to
      <a href="../../../doc/steps/general/languages.html">support one or multiple languages</a>.
    </p>
    
<p>
      Most installers install files to a dedicated directory and optionally to several existing directories
      on the target computer. That's what the <a href="../../../doc/steps/files/files.html">"Files" section</a> in
      the install4j IDE is for. Here, you define a "distribution tree", and optionally "installation components"
      which can also be <a href="../../../doc/steps/media/steps/dataFiles.html">downloaded on demand</a>.
      The actual installation of these files is handled by a special action (the "Install files" action) which
      is part of the default project template. If your installers should not install any files, you can remove that
      action and ignore the "Files" configuration section.
      When the the "Install files" action is executed, it creates an uninstaller. The uninstaller offers the same
      flexibility as the installer and is configured in the same way.
    </p>
    
<p>
      Unless the installed files are only static data, you will need application launchers to allow the user to
      start your application. You can define one or several application launchers in the
      <a href="../../../doc/steps/launcher/launcher.html">"Launchers" section</a>. Launchers generated by install4j have a rich set
      of configuration options including an optional splash screen or advanced features like a single instance mode.
      Configured launchers can also be "services" that run independently of logged-on users. install4j
      offers special installation screens and actions for services.
    </p>
    
<p>
      install4j has many advanced features concerning the runtime-detection or bundling of JREs. You define
      <a href="../../../doc/steps/general/javaVersion.html">Java version constraints and a search sequence</a> for
      both your installers and your generated launchers. In this way, you ensure that the launchers run with the same
      JRE as your installers. Bundling of JREs is configured on a
      <a href="../../../doc/steps/media/steps/bundledJre.html">per-media set basis</a> and includes an optional
      on-demand download of a JRE.
    </p>
    
<p>
      Finally, the media file definitions define the actual executables that you distribute. They capture platform-specific
      information and provide several ways to override project settings. You typically define one media file for each
      platform. Multiple media files for the same platform can be added as needed. Media files are either installers
      or archives. Archives simply capture the launchers and the distribution tree. Archives are a limited
      way to create a distribution and might not be suitable if you rely on the flexibility that is offered by installers.
    </p>
    
<h3>3. Project reports</h3>
    
<p>
      A project, and especially the definition of the installer and uninstaller, is very hierarchical and possibly
      quite complex. In order to check all your projects settings on a single page, or to print out your project
      definition, install4j offers a <img style="vertical-align: middle" align="middle" border="0" src="../../../doc/images/report_16.png">&nbsp;project report.
      This action is available from the menu and toolbar. When you generate a report, an HTML file is written to disk.
      In addition, a directory named <tt>install4j_images</tt> is created which holds all required icons.
      The export directory for project reports is remembered across restarts of install4j. install4j will suggest
      a file name based on the project name. If that file already exists, a number will be appended to
       make the file name unique.
