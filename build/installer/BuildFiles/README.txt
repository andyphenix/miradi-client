INSTALLING

Projects created with earlier versions of Miradi can be opened 
with later versions. They will be migrated automatically when 
you first open them with the new version.



MS Windows:
    IMPORTANT NOTE: If you have Miradi 2.3.1 or earlier installed on 
    Windows, you MUST uninstall it before installing this version. 
    Your existing projects will not be affected by the uninstall, 
    and will be available when you start the new Miradi version.
    If you have been Miradi 2.4 or later, you do not need to 
    uninstall it first. Just install this version over it.
    
- Download and run MiradiSetup.exe
- A copy of the latest Marine Example project will be installed automatically
- You do not need to have Java already installed on your system, because 
  the installer will offer to automatically download one if necessary.
  If you choose to automatically install Java, it will be (by default) at:
     C:\Program Files\Common Files\i4j_jres


Mac OS X:
    IMPORTANT NOTE: If you had manually installed Miradi 2.3.1 or earlier 
    (from a .zip file) on a Mac, you MUST uninstall the third-party 
    components before installing this new version. To uninstall them, 
    open each of these folders:
      - System/Library/Java/Extensions
      - Users/[user]/Library/Java/Extensions
    and if any of these files exist, delete them:
      - BrowserLauncher2-all-10rc4.jar
      - jcalendar-1.3.2.jar
      - jing.jar
      - jxl.jar
      - miradi-jgraph.jar
      - TableLayout.jar
    If you do not have the Martus (Human Rights) application on your system,
    delete the following files also:
      - icu4j_3_2_calendar.jar
      - martus-swing.jar
      - martus-utils.jar
      - persiancalendar.jar

- Before installing Miradi, make sure Apple's official Java J2SE5 or J2SE6 
  is installed (Miradi will not work with Java 1.4). If you are running 
  a current version of OS X, Java should have been installed automatically.
- Download Miradi.dmg from http://miradi.org and open it
- Copy the .app file to your desktop, or to your Applications folder, or 
  wherever you wish to launch it from
- MarineExample.mpz is a sample project that can be imported into Miradi 
  after you start the app


GNU/Linux:

- Make sure Sun's official Java 1.5 (aka Java 5) or 1.6 (aka Java 6) is 
  installed (Miradi will not work with Java 1.4, and has not been tested 
  with any non-Sun Java alternatives such as kaffe or gij)

- Obtain Miradi-Linux.zip from http://miradi.org and unzip the contents 
  into a directory, perhaps /usr/local/lib or ~/Miradi-2.0
  (We recommend not installing to ~/Miradi because that is the default 
  location for project data).

- To run Miradi, use this command line:
    java -Xmx512m -jar <path-to-miradi.jar>
    
- MarineExample.mpz is a sample project that can be imported into Miradi
  after you start the app

  ConPro system, and then imported into Miradi as CPMZ files,

NOTES FOR MIRADI 1.0 USERS ONLY: 

1. On MS Windows, if your Documents directory is not on your C: drive, 
you may get a warning during installation. In this case, you will need to 
manually copy any old projects from the old project data location to the 
new one. Both directories will be mentioned in the warning message.

2. If you created your own shortcut to run Miradi, it will need to be 
updated. Instead of launching java manually, the shortcut should now 
execute one of the miradi launchers, which have .vbs extensions and 
can be found in the same directory as miradi.jar.
