INSTALLING

MS Windows:
- If you had Miradi 2.3.1 or earlier, we recommend that you uninstall it 
  before installing Miradi 2.4 or later. Your existing projects will not 
  be affected by the uninstall, and will be available when you start the 
  new Miradi version.
- Download and run MiradiSetup.exe
- A copy of the latest Marine Example project will be installed automatically
- You do not need to have Java already installed on your system, because 
  the installer will offer to automatically download one if necessary.
  If you choose to automatically install Java, it will be (by default) at:
     C:\Program Files\Common Files\i4j_jres


Mac OS X:
- Make sure Apple's official Java 1.5 (aka Java 5) or 1.6 (aka Java 6) 
  is installed (Miradi will not work with Java 1.4). If you are running 
  a current version of OS X, Java should have been installed automatically.
  
- IMPORTANT: If you had manually installed Miradi earlier (from a .zip file), 
  you MUST uninstall the third-party components before installing this new 
  version. To uninstall them, open each of these folders:
    System/Library/Java/Extensions
    Users/[user]/Library/Java/Extensions
  and if any of these files exist, delete them:
      BrowserLauncher2-all-10rc4.jar
      jcalendar-1.3.2.jar
      jing.jar
      jxl.jar
      miradi-jgraph.jar
      TableLayout.jar
  If you do not have the Martus (Human Rights) application on your system,
  delete the following files also:
      icu4j_3_2_calendar.jar
      martus-swing.jar
      martus-utils.jar
      persiancalendar.jar

- Obtain Miradi.dmg from http://miradi.org and open it
- Copy the .app file to your desktop, or to your Applications folder, or 
  wherever you wish to launch it from
- MarineExample.mpz is a sample project that can be imported into Miradi. 


GNU/Linux:

- Make sure Sun's official Java 1.5 (aka Java 5) or 1.6 (aka Java 6) is 
  installed (Miradi will not work with Java 1.4, and has not been tested 
  with any non-Sun Java alternatives such as kaffe or gij)

- Obtain Miradi-Linux.zip from http://miradi.org and unzip the contents 
  into a directory, perhaps /usr/local/lib or ~/Miradi-2.0
  (We recommend not installing to ~/Miradi because that is the default 
  location for project data).

- To run Miradi, use this command line:
    java -Xmx512m -jar <path-to-miradi.jar>
    
- MarineExample.mpz is a sample project that can be imported into Miradi



---------------------
Upgrading From Earlier Versions

If you installed an earlier version of Miradi, you can just 
install this new version right over it. Your projects will be 
migrated automatically when you first open them with the new version.

NOTES FOR MIRADI 1.0 USERS ONLY: 

1. On MS Windows, if your Documents directory is not on your C: drive, 
you may get a warning during installation. In this case, you will need to 
manually copy any old projects from the old project data location to the 
new one. Both directories will be mentioned in the warning message.

2. If you created your own shortcut to run Miradi, it will need to be 
updated. Instead of launching java manually, the shortcut should now 
execute one of the miradi launchers, which have .vbs extensions and 
can be found in the same directory as miradi.jar.
